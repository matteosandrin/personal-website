    The display shows a real-time view of the incoming trains for either New
    York or Boston subway stops. It's powered by five 32x32 dot matrix LED
    displays daisy-chained and controlled by a Rasbperry Pi. The MTA and MBTA
    fonts were faithfully re-created pixel-by-pixel from hundreds of reference
    pictures, along with the specific copy and timing of announcements. The
    final product is an exact and functional replica of both the MTA's and
    MBTA's arrival boards. The display can also show currently playing songs and
    album art from Spotify.

    The real display hangs in my home, but I've made the web simulation above with WebGL to show what it looks like in action. It's currently showing arrivals
