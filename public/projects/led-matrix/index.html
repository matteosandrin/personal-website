    The display shows a real-time view of the incoming trains for either New York or
    Boston subway stops. It's powered by five 32x32 dot matrix LED displays
    daisy-chained and controlled by a Rasbperry Pi. The MTA and MBTA fonts were
    faithfully re-created pixel-by-pixel from hundreds of reference pictures,
    along with the specific copy and timing of announcements. The final product
    is an exact and functional replica of both the MTA's and MBTA's arrival
    boards. The display can also show currently playing songs and album art from
    Spotify.
