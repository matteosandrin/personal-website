    The chapter follows the intersecting lives of Robert Moses and Alfred E.
    Smith, two men whose unlikely partnership would leave a lasting mark on New
    York’s political landscape. At the heart of the story is a vivid contrast
    between their backgrounds and the different routes that led each to public
    service, as well as an exploration of how their relationship shaped the
    direction of reform and governance in the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    Robert Moses grew up surrounded by privilege. His childhood was filled with
    private tutors, leisurely afternoons in Central Park, and the confidence
    that came from his family’s social standing. Academic success came easily to
    him, and he carried himself with the assurance that his upbringing allowed.
    Alfred E. Smith, on the other hand, knew only hardship in the crowded
    streets of New York’s Fourth Ward. Raised in a Catholic neighborhood under
    the shadow of Tammany Hall, Smith lost his father early and left school at
    thirteen to help support his family. His education was limited, and he was
    known more for his lively personality than for any scholarly achievements.
    Smith’s entry into politics wasn’t born from academic distinction but from
    necessity and the connections he forged, especially through the support of
    Tammany Hall boss Tom Foley.

    The chapter takes a closer look at the personalities and social skills that
    set Moses and Smith apart. For Smith, lacking wealth meant he had to rely on
    sociability and friendship to climb the political ladder. He became a
    familiar face in parish theater, was always ready to lend a hand with
    sensitive community issues, and steadily built his influence in local clubs.
    His loyalty to family and community, along with his dependability, earned
    him opportunities from Tammany Hall. When Smith was elected to the state
    assembly, he initially found the legislative process overwhelming,
    struggling with the technical language and formalities due to his limited
    schooling. Still, his approachable nature helped him fit in, and over time,
    he learned the ropes of state politics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Smith’s early legislative career was defined by hard work and persistence.
    He spent countless nights poring over bills, determined to master the
    details, even when his committee assignments were unimpressive and his
    finances were stretched thin. Rather than seek a more comfortable job, Smith
    stuck with it, gradually earning respect from colleagues on both sides of
    the aisle. He formed important friendships with figures like Jimmy Wadsworth
    and Robert Wagner, and his growing expertise, combined with his engaging
    personality, eventually made him a standout speaker and a leading Democrat.
    Yet his rise was not without controversy. Reformers and newspapers often
    accused him of being a Tammany puppet, especially after his involvement with
    the contentious “Murphy Charter.” Despite these criticisms, Smith’s journey
    from overlooked assemblyman to influential majority leader highlighted his
    resilience and ability to adapt.
  </p>

  <p>
    A pivotal moment arrived with the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which
    spurred Smith and other reformers to push for stronger labor protections.
    Smith joined the State Factory Investigating Commission, where his
    commitment and compassion won over even his critics. He championed reforms
    like better working conditions and widows’ pensions, and his genuine
    advocacy led many to see him as a true force for social change. Although
    Republican opposition initially blocked some of his efforts, Smith’s
    leadership was recognized when Democrats regained control, and he was
    elected Assembly Speaker in 1913.
  </p>

  <p>
    Smith’s ascent defied the expectations set for someone of his background. As
    Speaker, he managed to balance Tammany interests with a push for progressive
    reforms, especially in areas like workmen’s compensation and labor rights.
    He encouraged Tammany to support social welfare legislation, understanding
    both its real benefits and its political value. Under Charlie Murphy’s
    guidance, Tammany began to back Smith’s reform agenda, which eventually led
    to Smith’s nomination for Governor in 1918—a turning point for both Smith
    and the party.
  </p>

  <p>
    Smith’s election as governor was a powerful symbol for immigrants and the
    working class. He showed his independence by appointing reformers and even
    Republicans to important positions, and he favored compromise over rigid
    ideology. Though he remained wary of most reformers, Smith developed a
    close, almost familial bond with Robert Moses, bringing him into his trusted
    circle.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, Robert Moses was making a name for himself in the reform
    movement. Recruited by Richard Childs for his dedication to scientific
    management and municipal reform, Moses quickly became a key player,
    advocating for social welfare and greater transparency in government.
    However, as his relationship with Smith deepened, Moses began to shift from
    an idealistic reformer to a more pragmatic political operator. His
    aggressive tactics during the 1922 gubernatorial campaign alienated many of
    his former allies and undermined the nonpartisan spirit of the reform
    movement. In the end, Moses fully embraced his new role within Smith’s
    administration, setting the stage for a powerful partnership that would
    shape the next era of New York politics.
