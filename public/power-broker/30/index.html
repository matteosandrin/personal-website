    <p>This chapter vividly recounts the fierce clash between Robert Moses and a determined group of reformers over the future of Battery Park’s historic fort and beloved Aquarium. After losing a political battle to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Moses set his sights on the Aquarium and the old fort, claiming they were outdated and structurally unsound. However, engineers and members of the public repeatedly challenged these claims, emphasizing the sites’ historical and emotional importance. Despite mounting opposition, Moses pushed relentlessly for their demolition, making it clear to many that his campaign was driven more by personal vendetta than by genuine public need.</p>

<p>Using his vast administrative power, Moses shut down Battery Park and the Aquarium, citing public safety concerns related to tunnel construction. He further tightened his grip by tying the Aquarium’s fate to crucial funding, leaving officials with little choice but to fall in line. Political leaders, wary of Moses’ influence and mindful of upcoming elections, gradually abandoned their resistance. Even Mayor La Guardia, despite his private doubts, eventually sided with Moses. Legal efforts by reformers to halt the destruction went nowhere, as the courts consistently upheld Moses’ sweeping authority over city parks. Although World War II shortages temporarily delayed the demolition, Moses kept the park closed for more than five years, a move that underscored both his power and the seeming hopelessness of opposing him.</p>

<p>Yet the fight to preserve Castle Clinton was far from over. Led by George McAneny and a group of dedicated allies, reformers continued to challenge Moses’ misleading statements and lobbied federal officials for support. Their persistence finally paid off in 1950, when Congress designated the fort a national monument, marking a rare win for historic preservation. Still, the victory was bittersweet. While Castle Clinton was saved, the Aquarium was lost and replaced by a more expensive, less accessible facility at Coney Island, a change that highlighted Moses’ tendency to favor projects that separated the city by class. In the end, the episode left reformers disillusioned and wary, their view of Moses forever altered. It marked a turning point, not only in their perception of his legacy but also in the city’s sense of its own autonomy.</p>
