    <p>This chapter paints a vivid picture of the sweeping administrative changes that transformed New York State in the 1920s, with Robert Moses at the center of it all. The story opens with the political battle that led to the State Department Law of 1926, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that merged 187 scattered state agencies into just 18 departments. This overhaul didn’t just make government more efficient—it also gave the governor far greater control, setting the stage for real change. Governor Al Smith seized this opportunity, using the new streamlined system to push through progressive reforms: better working conditions, expanded public housing, higher salaries for teachers, and even lower state taxes. While Moses himself wasn’t driven by a passion for social welfare, his knack for administrative innovation was crucial in building the framework that made these advances possible.</p>

<p>Moses’ rise to Secretary of State in 1927 was anything but smooth. His nomination stirred up fierce debate among political insiders from both parties, but ordinary New Yorkers—grateful for his work making parks accessible—rallied to his side. In the end, it was Smith’s political savvy that secured Moses the job, highlighting both the contentious nature of reform and the lasting mark Moses would leave on state government. Once in office, Moses attacked corruption with gusto, particularly in areas like boxing regulation. He wasn’t immune to mistakes, especially when he ventured into unfamiliar territory, but his most important contributions often happened quietly, as he sped up major public works projects under Smith’s guidance—building hospitals, parks, and vital infrastructure.</p>

<p>The chapter also offers a glimpse into Moses’ relentless drive and the personal sacrifices he made to keep up his extraordinary pace. He cut out nearly all leisure and social activities, leaving household matters to his wife and even arranging for barbers to come to his office. Moses squeezed productivity out of every moment, turning his car into a traveling workspace and holding meetings on the go. He depended heavily on his secretary, Miss Tappan, who ran his office with military discipline and was always on call thanks to a dedicated car and drivers. Moses kept his office running smoothly by refusing lunch invitations, installing a special phone system to minimize interruptions, and swapping his desk for a table to avoid clutter. Still, the constant pressure took its toll—his handwriting grew sloppy, he nicked himself shaving, and his temper became more unpredictable, sometimes boiling over in physical outbursts.</p>

<p>As the narrative unfolds, we see Moses evolve from a sensitive young man into a commanding, sometimes intimidating leader. His impatience and fierce temper created a tense environment for his staff, though he remained courteous and even warm toward women, especially his secretaries. Water became his refuge; he sought out river views and swam daily to recharge. Moses had a keen eye for talent, promoted people quickly, and insisted on strict adherence to hierarchy, usually communicating with staff through memos.</p>

<p>He demanded total loyalty and tireless effort from his aides, expecting them to be available around the clock and fostering an atmosphere where disagreement was rare. Moses personally trained his team, especially in communication, and rewarded loyalty with rapid promotions and creative perks. The pressure sometimes led to breakdowns, but those who stuck it out often found real pride and purpose in their work, helping to bring about major public works across the state.</p>

<p>With Smith’s backing, Moses became the second most powerful figure in New York, wielding his authority with confidence and, at times, arrogance. He brushed aside local opposition, ignored legal obstacles when they got in the way of his projects, and always put progress first. Yet, he knew when to compromise, especially when dealing with powerful interests, as shown in his negotiations with wealthy Long Island landowners over the Northern State Parkway—a sharp contrast to his treatment of less influential farmers.</p>

<p>The chapter wraps up by highlighting Moses’ deep loyalty to Al Smith and his emotional investment in Smith’s presidential campaign. As Smith’s time in office drew to a close, Moses worked frantically to push his park projects forward, worried that a new administration might bring everything to a halt. This urgency, combined with his loyalty, reveals the forces that drove Moses’ relentless pursuit of reform and progress.</p>
