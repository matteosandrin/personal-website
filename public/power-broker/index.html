      I hope everyone reads "The Power Broker", but I recognize it's not
      realistic for most people to invest six months in doing so. I created this
      repository of chapter summaries as an easier on-ramp to the book, and to
      provide a concise overview of the key themes and events in each chapter. I
      hope it will inspire readers to take on the full thing.

      This book is the biography of Robert Moses, the influential yet
      controversial public official who built almost every highway, bridge, park
      and dam in New York (state and city). It's a story about how power is
      obtained, wielded and lost. It's a tale of hubris, ambition, and what it
      takes to make big ideas into reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also a treasure trove of information about why the infrastructure of
      New York City is the way it is. Why is there no direct train connection to
      JFK airport? Why is the island of Manhattan completely cut off from its
      waterfront by highways? Answers to these questions and more lay within the
      pages of this book (see
      <a href="/power-broker/25" class="link">chapter 25</a>
      and
      <a href="/power-broker/39" class="link">chapter 39</a>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      The summaries were generated by an AI model and personally fact-checked by
      me.
