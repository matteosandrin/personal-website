    <p>This chapter traces the interconnected rise of Belle Moskowitz, Al Smith, and Robert Moses as they helped usher in a new era for New York State government, blending lofty reform ideals with the realities of political life. The story opens with Belle Moskowitz, who began her career as a modest social worker but quickly proved herself as a force behind the scenes. Though initially underestimated, Belle set herself apart by turning reformist ambitions into real results. Her efforts to regulate exploitative dance academies and her fair handling of labor disputes earned her a reputation for both effectiveness and integrity. These qualities caught the eye of Alfred E. Smith, who would later become governor. Recognizing her talents, Smith appointed Belle as the executive head of a major state commission, a position that not only expanded her influence but also gave her the opportunity to bring Bob Moses on board as chief of staff, paving the way for his own rapid ascent.</p>

<p>The chapter then shifts to the political environment Smith faced on his way to the governor’s office. Many reformers dismissed Smith as a product of the corrupt Tammany Hall machine, seeing him as uneducated and beholden to party bosses. Belle, however, saw something more in him. Although Smith was initially wary of reformers and skeptical about women’s involvement in politics, Belle’s strategic advice gradually won him over. She helped him reach out to newly enfranchised women voters and independent groups, broadening his appeal. After Smith’s unexpected victory, he leaned heavily on Belle’s guidance, including her recommendation to create a Commission for Reconstruction, Retrenchment, and Reorganization. This move was designed to attract progressive Republicans and divide the opposition, while also tackling the tangled and inefficient state government structure that Smith had inherited.</p>

<p>A major theme running through the chapter is the effort to shift administrative power from the Legislature to the Governor, an idea championed by the Bureau of Municipal Research. The Bureau pushed for consolidating state agencies, lengthening the governor’s term, and introducing an executive budget system. While some of these reforms were adopted at the 1915 Constitutional Convention, they ultimately failed in a public referendum, largely due to political opposition. Under Belle’s mentorship, Bob Moses learned to balance his idealism with the practical demands of politics. He came to understand the importance of compromise, patronage, and alliances in achieving meaningful reform. This evolution is clear in Moses’s growing political savvy and his careful efforts to avoid embarrassing the Governor as he navigated the complexities of power.</p>

<p>As head of the State Reconstruction Commission, Moses brought relentless energy and high standards to the job. His staff admired his drive and sense of purpose, even as they struggled with long hours and limited pay. Moses’s demanding yet inspiring leadership style built strong loyalty among his team, and his personal vigor—whether demonstrated through marathon swims or tireless work—became the stuff of legend. Despite scarce resources, Moses managed to produce a comprehensive government reorganization report. The document stood out for its clear, passionate writing and its call for greater citizen involvement and stronger executive authority. While the report was widely praised as a model for modern state government reform, Moses’s insistence on sole authorship led to some friction with his collaborators.</p>

<p>To turn the report’s recommendations into reality, a Citizens Committee was formed, with Moses serving as secretary. He expanded the committee’s reach by enlisting prominent members and securing essential funding, which allowed the group to operate independently and support Governor Smith’s legislative agenda. Smith’s persuasive leadership, combined with Moses’s technical expertise and Belle’s political finesse, helped push most of the reforms through the legislature, though some measures were blocked after Smith lost his re-election bid in a Republican landslide.</p>

<p>The chapter closes with a look at the growing partnership between Moses and Smith, symbolized by their walks together through the Lower East Side. Smith’s popularity and openness to Moses’s ideas marked the beginning of a new collaboration between reformers and political leaders, setting the stage for future successes in New York State government.</p>
