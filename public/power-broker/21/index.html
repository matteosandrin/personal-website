    <p>This chapter delves into the tumultuous 1934 New York gubernatorial race, centering on Robert Moses’ unsuccessful bid for office and the tangled web of political maneuvering that defined it. At its heart, the narrative examines how ambition, ideology, and the pursuit of power collided among New York’s political elite during a time of sweeping progressive reforms and fierce resistance from established conservative forces.</p>

<p>In 1934, New York’s Republican Party was riven by internal conflict. The Old Guard, representing entrenched business and property interests, found itself challenged by a new generation of reformers led by W. Kingsland Macy. Alarmed by Macy’s progressive agenda and his efforts to nominate an anti-utility reformer, the Old Guard scrambled to reassert control. Their solution was to put forward a candidate who could project the image of a reformer while quietly protecting their interests behind the scenes. Robert Moses, celebrated for his work on public parks and civic projects, seemed the perfect figurehead. Although Moses publicly claimed he was reluctant to run, evidence points to his eagerness for the nomination, which was orchestrated by Trubee Davison, a well-connected member of the elite. This alliance with the very establishment Moses had once opposed underscored the pragmatic, sometimes contradictory, path of his political rise.</p>

<p>Moses’ campaign leaned heavily on his reputation as an idealist and reformer, but beneath the surface, he was closely aligned with the conservative Old Guard. He was willing to make concessions to powerful interests, such as rerouting parkways to avoid disturbing wealthy estates, even as he maintained a progressive public image. Most voters and journalists remained unaware of this duplicity, seeing Moses as a champion of reform, when in fact he had helped craft much of the anti-New Deal platform. This gap between perception and reality set the tone for a campaign marked by friction and isolation. Moses managed to alienate both young Republicans and former Democratic allies, running a campaign that was increasingly disconnected from the electorate.</p>

<p>The campaign itself quickly unraveled. Moses, who had once enjoyed the support of influential figures like Aaron Rabinowitz and Henry Moskowitz, lost their backing by demanding loyalty that clashed with their other commitments. His relationship with the press soured after just one tense conference, and he made a critical misstep by assuming Mayor La Guardia’s endorsement without confirmation, prompting the mayor to publicly withdraw support. On the stump, Moses advocated for unpopular policies, such as a state sales tax, in areas where such proposals were deeply unpopular, and he openly criticized fellow Republicans, further alienating his base. Eschewing traditional campaign tactics, he limited his appearances to formal speeches, drastically reducing his visibility and failing to connect with voters.</p>

<p>A particularly revealing aspect of the chapter is Moses’ fraught relationship with his Jewish heritage. Although he was Jewish through his mother, Moses went out of his way to deny this identity, sending his daughters to Episcopalian schools and making disparaging remarks about Jews. These statements offended many in the Jewish community, who saw him as having turned his back on his roots. This personal struggle bled into his political life, as Moses’ defensive and combative approach—repeatedly denying ties to the Old Guard and launching personal attacks on Governor Herbert Lehman—proved ineffective against Lehman’s reputation for honesty and public service.</p>

<p>Lehman, for his part, responded to Moses’ attacks with calm and focus. Rather than engage in personal mudslinging, he stuck to the issues and his own record. When Moses accused him of corruption and cowardice, the charges were either baseless or easily disproven. Moses’ rhetoric grew increasingly harsh, culminating in an accusation that Lehman was lying about milk price controls—a claim that was quickly debunked and even shocked Moses’ own supporters.</p>

<p>As the campaign spiraled, Moses’ attacks became more personal and bitter, targeting not just Lehman but also former allies and, at times, their deceased relatives. Key supporters began to distance themselves, and what had started as a political campaign devolved into a series of personal vendettas. Only Alfred E. Smith, a former governor and friend, escaped Moses’ ire, though Smith’s refusal to endorse him left Moses feeling betrayed.</p>

<p>In the end, Moses suffered a historic defeat, losing by more than 800,000 votes—the worst performance by a major party candidate in New York’s history. His abrasive style and inability to connect with voters not only doomed his own campaign but also contributed to the Republican Party’s loss of both legislative chambers. The chapter closes by reflecting on the reasons for Moses’ failure: despite his political savvy and record of public achievement, his arrogance and disdain for others alienated the very people he hoped to lead. Ultimately, his downfall highlighted the limits of relying on association with popular causes rather than genuine personal appeal, and underscored the crucial role of character and connection in democratic politics.</p>
