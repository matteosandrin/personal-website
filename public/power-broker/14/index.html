    The chapter follows Robert Moses’s remarkable rise within New York’s state
    park system, charting how his early idealism gradually gave way to a more
    pragmatic and autocratic style of leadership. At first, Moses was fueled by
    a genuine passion for expanding parks and creating recreational spaces.
    However, as he gained more authority, his natural arrogance and
    impatience—traits shaped in part by his strong-willed mother—became more
    pronounced. Once he became president of the Long Island State Park
    Commission, Moses began to brush aside colleagues, legislators, and the
    public, showing little tolerance for disagreement or alternative ideas. This
    change was especially clear in his dealings with older commissioners who
    valued conservation and restraint, sparking both philosophical and personal
    clashes.

    Moses’s climb to power was made possible through strategic partnerships with
    established park figures like Judge Ellis J. Staley and Judge Alphonse
    Trumpbore Clearwater. In the beginning, he leaned on their reputations and
    support to secure funding and push his ambitious projects forward, promising
    them continued influence. But after consolidating his position as chairman
    of the State Parks Council, Moses quickly marginalized these allies, taking
    control of decisions and rejecting their budget requests. The veteran
    commissioners, who cared deeply about preservation and local access, soon
    found themselves sidelined as Moses focused on large-scale projects that
    often overlooked the needs of the poor. His quest for power became an end in
    itself, most notably in his treatment of Judge Clearwater, who, despite his
    loyalty, was ultimately pushed aside.

    The chapter also explores the contributions of Ansley Wilcox, a reformer and
    park commissioner who played a key role in establishing Niagara State Park.
    Wilcox was deeply committed to protecting the Niagara gorge from industrial
    development, working tirelessly to secure land and funding. Even as his
    health declined, he remained dedicated to improving the park and extending
    its parkway, collaborating with local leaders and drawing on personal
    connections. Despite their shared interest in park development, Wilcox and
    the Niagara Commission soon found themselves at odds with Moses, who favored
    centralized control over local oversight. This disagreement led to mounting
    tensions over who should manage the parks and how funds should be allocated.
  </p>

  <p>
    One particularly heated episode arose when the Governor hinted at possible
    misconduct by the Niagara commissioners in their dealings with a power
    company. Moses responded by launching an investigation, carefully excluding
    the commissioners’ prepared defenses and filling the committee with his own
    supporters. During the hearing, the commissioners—especially Wilcox—pressed
    for specifics about the accusations but received few answers. Although the
    committee eventually cleared them of wrongdoing, Moses withheld this
    outcome, sharing only technical recommendations and leaving Wilcox feeling
    both frustrated and unwell.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’s tactics went beyond bureaucratic maneuvering. He accused Wilcox of
    impropriety and selectively released correspondence to shape public opinion.
    Determined to erase the legacy of the previous commissioners, he replaced
    their commemorations with his own and spread misleading stories about their
    effectiveness. Despite the commissioners’ dignified resistance, Moses’s grip
    on power only tightened.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, Moses’s dominance was secured through his close alliance with
    Governor Al Smith. Their relationship, built on mutual respect and genuine
    friendship, gave Moses the political backing he needed to silence critics
    and centralize control. With Smith’s unwavering support, Moses transformed
    New York’s parks into powerful tools for political influence and personal
    legacy.
