    In this chapter, the bustling streets of early 20th-century New York City
    set the stage for a wave of young reformers inspired by the ideals of
    Progressivism. Energized by the investigative journalism of muckrakers like
    Lincoln Steffens and Jacob Riis, these activists set out to tackle the
    unchecked corporate power and deep-seated political corruption that gripped
    the city. They believed that, if properly directed, democracy could serve as
    a powerful engine for social improvement. Nowhere was the need for reform
    more apparent than in New York, where the chaos and graft of city government
    made it a focal point for change.

    At the heart of this movement stood the Bureau of Municipal Research,
    founded by William H. Allen, Henry Bruère, and Frederick A. Cleveland. The
    Bureau broke new ground by applying scientific management and empirical
    analysis to city administration. Rather than simply swapping out corrupt
    officials, they pushed for a more systematic overhaul, emphasizing
    efficiency and businesslike practices. Their investigations exposed fraud,
    such as payments for supplies that never arrived, and their detailed reports
    paved the way for a new era of municipal reform.

    The Bureau’s reputation soared after an investigation led by John Purroy
    Mitchel confirmed widespread corruption and led to the ousting of dishonest
    officials. Among its most significant contributions were the introduction of
    the city’s first municipal budget and the practice of itemized spending,
    both of which brought a new level of transparency to government operations.
    The Bureau’s Training School for Public Service drew in idealistic
    university graduates, including a young Robert Moses, who was initially
    captivated by the Bureau’s sense of purpose.

    However, Moses soon grew disillusioned with what he saw as the Bureau’s
    obsession with procedure at the expense of real action. His drive to
    revitalize neglected areas like Riverside Park clashed with the Bureau’s
    more cautious, methodical approach. Moses’s impatience and direct criticism
    put him at odds with senior staff, creating friction within the
    organization. Despite these setbacks, he found an ally in Mary Louise Sims,
    a dedicated secretary who supported his ambitions. In the end, Moses’s
    abilities did not go unnoticed. Mayor Mitchel appointed him as an advisor to
    the Civil Service Commission, giving Moses the opportunity to pursue
    meaningful reforms and turn his vision into reality.
