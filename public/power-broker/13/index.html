    This chapter traces Robert Moses’s intense ambition and transformative
    leadership during a crucial era for New York’s parks and parkways, with a
    spotlight on the creation of Jones Beach and the rapid growth of Long
    Island’s park system. After a heated dispute over bathhouses, Moses found
    himself not victorious, but anxious. He realized that Governor Al Smith’s
    looming departure could jeopardize both his political backing and the future
    of his grand plans. With time running out, Moses turned August Belmont’s
    mansion into a bustling headquarters, where he enforced strict deadlines and
    demanded detailed, fact-based updates from his staff. His relentless work
    schedule, often stretching from sunrise to midnight, set a grueling pace
    that his team felt compelled to match. Even during family outings, Moses’s
    dedication was on full display, inspiring those around him to keep up.

    Despite the pressure, Moses managed to foster a sense of unity and
    excitement among his staff. The demanding environment became a shared
    adventure, strengthened by a familial atmosphere. He often brought his own
    family into the workplace and organized informal gatherings that helped
    colleagues bond. Moses encouraged his team to think creatively, insisting on
    unique design touches like distinctive bridges and wooden guardrails
    reinforced with steel cable. He welcomed imaginative ideas, such as the
    playful signage at Jones Beach. Although he lacked formal training in law or
    engineering, Moses’s broad knowledge and sweeping vision motivated his team
    to push beyond their limits, tackling enormous physical and political
    obstacles with determination.

    The building of Jones Beach showcased the scale of these challenges. Moses
    and his team faced brutal winter weather, with surveyors working in
    isolation and surviving on little more than pancakes as they completed
    crucial surveys. They soon discovered that the barrier beach was dangerously
    low, which meant they had to undertake a massive hydraulic fill operation
    using the country’s largest dredges. To combat the problem of blowing sand,
    workers planted millions of clumps of beach grass by hand. When money ran
    short, Moses didn’t hesitate to borrow $20,000 from his mother to pay the
    workers, demonstrating his willingness to make personal sacrifices. Legal
    and political roadblocks, including disputes with wealthy landowners and
    resistance from Babylon Township, were met with Moses’s characteristic
    persistence and strategic maneuvering.

    The battle for Babylon’s land reached its climax in a contentious
    referendum. Moses used legal loopholes and manipulated voting procedures to
    secure the outcome he needed. Although this sparked outrage among locals, it
    allowed the state to acquire Jones Beach and press ahead with the rapid
    construction of the Southern State Parkway and causeway. By 1928, Moses had
    expanded Long Island’s park system from a single park to fourteen, built an
    extensive network of parkways, and preserved scenic sites upstate, making
    parks accessible to millions. His accomplishments, closely aligned with his
    original vision, reshaped the region’s landscape and recreational life,
    securing his reputation as a visionary builder and public servant.
