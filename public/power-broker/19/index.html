    The chapter traces the dramatic revival of New York City’s Good Government
    movement, or “Goo Goos,” in the early 1930s—a time when the city was reeling
    from economic crisis and rampant corruption. The movement’s resurgence was
    fueled by Samuel Seabury’s dogged investigations, which peeled back layers
    of graft and misconduct in city government. What began as a source of
    cynical amusement for the public soon turned into genuine outrage, as
    Seabury’s findings made it impossible to ignore the need for reform. With
    the Great Depression worsening, calls for change grew louder, and reformers
    set out to find a mayoral candidate who could inspire confidence and restore
    integrity to City Hall.

    Robert Moses quickly became the frontrunner among both veteran and younger
    reformers. He was widely respected for his administrative acumen and
    unblemished reputation, and his close ties to Al Smith—a former governor and
    reform legend—only strengthened his candidacy. Yet, beneath the surface,
    tensions simmered. Seabury, a principled legal mind with a lifelong grudge
    against Tammany Hall and its allies, could not bring himself to support
    Moses, whom he associated with Smith and the old political machine. This
    personal and political feud proved pivotal: Seabury’s refusal to back Moses
    led Moses to withdraw, leaving the Fusion Committee scrambling for
    alternatives.

    Finding a suitable nominee proved difficult. Well-known figures like Raymond
    Ingersoll and Nathan Straus turned down the offer, citing everything from
    health issues to fears of antisemitism—a concern heightened by the rise of
    Hitler in Europe. Meanwhile, Fiorello La Guardia, despite his outsider
    status and previous electoral losses, actively campaigned for the
    nomination. His fiery rhetoric and progressive politics, however, made many
    in the Fusion Conference Committee uneasy. They preferred someone from their
    own social circles and were wary of La Guardia’s populist approach, even
    though he had strong support among the city’s ethnic communities. At first,
    both reformers and Republican leaders resisted La Guardia, holding out hope
    for Moses.
  </p>

  <p>
    As political infighting escalated, Seabury, frustrated by the committee’s
    preference for Moses, accused its leaders of selling out to Tammany Hall and
    threatened to launch his own ticket. The committee’s eventual nomination of
    John F. O’Ryan did little to appease him; Seabury dismissed O’Ryan as too
    weak to take on the city’s entrenched interests. In the end, Seabury and
    Charles Culp Burlingham convinced the committee to nominate La Guardia.
    Although Moses had been sidelined by Seabury’s opposition, he ultimately
    threw his support behind La Guardia late in the campaign. Moses’s
    endorsement, coupled with his blistering attacks on Tammany Hall, helped
    solidify La Guardia’s image as a true reformer and played a key role in his
    victory.

  <p>
    Once in office, La Guardia wasted no time inviting Moses to join his
    administration. He admired Moses’s track record and recognized the need for
    someone with his expertise to secure federal funding and oversee ambitious
    public works projects. Moses agreed, but only if he was given unified
    control over the city’s parks and parkways. Through savvy political
    maneuvering and broad support from reformers, Moses amassed unprecedented
    authority, taking charge of seven major agencies and leaving a lasting
    imprint on the city’s infrastructure.

  <p>
    During the New Deal years, Moses’s leadership was marked by an unyielding
    drive to reshape New York’s parks and public spaces. Frustrated by the
    inefficiency of federal relief programs, he conducted a sweeping assessment
    of the city’s needs and assembled a team of top-notch professionals to carry
    out bold, innovative projects. His vision included transforming places like
    Orchard Beach, where he pushed for the removal of unsightly structures and
    the creation of a sweeping, sandy shoreline with striking new architecture.
    Moses’s approach ushered in a new era of urban transformation, blending
    grand ideas with practical execution and setting a high bar for the city’s
    future development.
