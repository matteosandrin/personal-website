    In this chapter, the story follows Mayor Fiorello La Guardia during his
    final year in office in 1945, as his health faltered and his political
    support crumbled. With his coalition falling apart and neither major party
    willing to back him for another term, La Guardia decided to step aside and
    threw his support behind reform candidate Newbold Morris. Meanwhile, Robert
    Moses, who had once stood firmly against Tammany Hall, surprised many by
    withholding criticism of their candidate, William O'Dwyer. O'Dwyer, eager
    for Moses’s expertise, offered him sweeping control over city construction
    projects. This move marked a turning point for Moses, who shifted from
    reformer to shrewd political operator. By the end of the chapter, La Guardia
    looked back with regret, realizing that Moses’s influence had become
    overwhelming. Observers like Binger shared this concern, highlighting just
    how much the balance of power in New York City had changed.
