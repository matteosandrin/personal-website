    This chapter traces the sweeping changes in how New York managed its
    transportation systems, centering on the intense rivalry between Governor
    Nelson Rockefeller and Robert Moses, the long-reigning authority over the
    city’s public works. For years, Rockefeller had quietly crafted a plan to
    bring the region’s tangled web of transportation agencies under his control.
    The opportunity finally arrived when Mayor Lindsay made his own move for
    control and Moses’s grip on power began to slip. At the heart of
    Rockefeller’s strategy was the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, still
    firmly in Moses’s hands and flush with cash—funds Rockefeller needed to
    realize his ambitious plans for highways, mass transit, and airports. By
    proposing to merge Triborough and other agencies into a single Metropolitan
    Transportation Authority (MTA), Rockefeller aimed to concentrate power and
    effectively push Moses aside.

    The chapter dives into the political and financial chess game that followed.
    Rockefeller’s push for a massive transportation bond issue was about more
    than just infrastructure; it was also a way to balance the state budget and
    avoid raising taxes, a crucial consideration with a possible presidential
    run on the horizon. Although the proposal drew support from the media and
    many politicians, it faced resistance from skeptical voters, especially
    conservatives upstate who feared higher taxes. Moses, still influential with
    labor unions and the press, initially fought the merger. He argued that it
    wouldn’t fix the subway’s financial woes and would saddle the state with
    unmanageable debt. He even threatened to publicly expose these weaknesses,
    putting Rockefeller’s entire plan at risk.

    But the story takes a turn when Moses, after a series of negotiations,
    unexpectedly changes course. His public endorsement wasn’t really secured by
    legal guarantees for bondholders, as officials claimed. Instead, Rockefeller
    privately promised Moses continued sway within the new MTA, including a seat
    on the board and control over select projects. With these assurances, Moses
    threw his weight behind the referendum, using Authority resources to
    campaign for it. He also dropped a legal challenge that might have blocked
    the merger, convinced that his influence would endure.

    In the end, the aftermath was stark. Once the merger went through, Moses
    found himself quietly pushed to the sidelines. The promises of ongoing power
    faded, leaving him with little more than a ceremonial advisory role. The
    chapter closes with a telling moment at a formal luncheon: Moses, who had
    once dominated the city’s public authorities, was now just another guest.
    This scene marks the close of his forty-four-year reign and underscores how
    political ambition, personal rivalry, and behind-the-scenes deals reshaped
    New York’s transportation system and brought an era of individual rule to a
    close.
