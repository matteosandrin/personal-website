    <p>This chapter takes a close look at the troubled and ultimately heartbreaking story of the Moses family, centering on the tense relationship between Robert Moses, the influential urban planner, and his brother Paul. Through a series of personal and professional clashes, the narrative explores themes of sibling rivalry, class attitudes, the corrupting nature of power, and the steep personal price of ambition and exclusion.</p>

<p>At the core of the chapter lies the deep divide between Robert and Paul, a rift fueled by disputes over family inheritance and professional opportunities. Paul accused Robert of manipulating their mother’s will to cut him out of the family fortune and of using his influence to block Paul from city jobs he believed he deserved. While it’s impossible to verify every detail—key witnesses are gone, and Paul died before he could fully tell his side—the chapter presents strong evidence that Robert did, in fact, use his power to hinder Paul’s career, as several city officials confirmed. This unresolved conflict is portrayed as both intensely personal and reflective of larger questions about power and justice.</p>

<p>Despite their differences, Robert and Paul had much in common. Both were bright, charismatic, and ambitious, shaped by the formidable women in their family, especially their mother, Bella. Yet their personalities and values couldn’t have been more different. Robert, heavily influenced by Bella, developed a patronizing attitude toward social class, seeing himself as a kind of benevolent overseer and reinforcing class divisions through his public projects. Paul, by contrast, was genuinely empathetic, treating people as equals and remembering the details of those whom Robert often overlooked. Their contrasting responses to their mother’s authority were telling: Robert learned to compromise and navigate political realities, while Paul openly defied her, even refusing a lucrative banking job arranged by the family.</p>

<p>Paul’s independent streak led him down a less traditional path, including time abroad and military service, while Robert’s adaptability propelled him to the top of public service. Yet Paul’s idealism and refusal to compromise left him on the sidelines, unable to secure the public roles he wanted—often because Robert was working against him behind the scenes. Their professional rivalry spilled over into their personal lives, most notably in Paul’s ambitious but ill-fated attempt to develop a swimming club in Pennsylvania. The project, which seemed partly inspired by competition with Robert’s Jones Beach, failed without Robert’s access to state funds and political connections, leaving Paul financially ruined and further estranged from the family.</p>

<p>The family conflict reached its lowest point after their mother’s death, when her will was read. Paul received only a small, restricted trust, while Robert and their sister Edna inherited the bulk of the estate. This decision devastated Paul, stripping him of financial security and deepening his sense of alienation and injustice. He believed Robert had manipulated their dying mother into signing a new will, motivated by his own financial needs. While some of Paul’s accusations were exaggerated or impossible to prove, interviews with relatives revealed that Robert’s influence had left a lasting negative impression of Paul within the family.</p>

<p>Paul’s professional struggles continued as he tried to serve the public as a utility regulator, aligning himself with reformist mayor La Guardia. Despite strong endorsements and successful consulting work, Paul was repeatedly denied a permanent position, largely due to Robert’s opposition. As consulting jobs dried up, Paul’s finances collapsed, made worse by his lavish spending and failed investments. Mounting debts, foreclosure, and personal hardships led to the breakdown of both his finances and his marriage, leaving him destitute and disillusioned.</p>

<p>The mismanagement of Paul’s trust fund only made things worse. Intended to provide him with a steady income, the fund was lost to bad investments and bank failures during the Depression. Paul’s efforts to recover financially were blocked by Robert, who refused to communicate or consider his proposals. The situation deteriorated further when Paul discovered that the trustees, including Robert, wanted to pay themselves commissions from the depleted trust. Legal challenges went nowhere, as his case was reassigned to a judge with ties to Robert, resulting in a ruling that mostly went against Paul.</p>

<p>As the years passed, Paul became increasingly isolated and bitter, his personality changing as he fixated on criticizing Robert. Despite his qualifications, he couldn’t find work, likely because Robert controlled many engineering jobs in New York. Even when opportunities arose in his field, such as the St. Lawrence hydroelectric project, Robert never offered him a position. Paul’s later years were marked by poverty and loneliness, living in a cramped room with only his loyal companion, Millie, for company. His proximity to City Hall reflected his lingering desire to be involved in public affairs, though younger officials often dismissed him as eccentric.</p>

<p>The chapter also explores Robert’s relationships with other family members, particularly his sister Edna and his wife Mary. Despite Edna’s lifelong devotion, Robert kept his distance from her and the rest of the extended family, suggesting a deliberate effort to cut ties with his roots. Mary Moses played a crucial role in Robert’s life, managing their home and supporting his career. However, as Robert’s power grew, Mary became increasingly withdrawn, struggling with personal issues and the emotional strain of living in his shadow.</p>

<p>In the end, the chapter paints a portrait of a family torn apart by ambition, rivalry, and the destructive effects of power. Paul Moses stands out as a tragic figure, a talented and idealistic man undone by both his brother’s interference and his own unwillingness to compromise. Robert Moses, for all his public achievements, emerges as someone who sacrificed personal relationships for power, leaving behind a legacy marked by both monumental accomplishments and deep personal loss.</p>
