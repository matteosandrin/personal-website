    <p>The chapter captures a pivotal moment in New York City’s political history, tracing the shift from Robert Moses’ long-standing dominance to the emergence of Mayor John V. Lindsay in the mid-1960s. For more than twenty years, Moses had been the city’s ultimate power broker, with politicians routinely seeking his approval. But Lindsay’s election in 1965 signaled a new direction. Unlike his predecessors, Lindsay and his allies didn’t shy away from criticizing Moses’ approach to parks, transportation, and housing. Their reform-minded energy promised sweeping changes, especially in how the city managed its public authorities. Lindsay, brimming with youthful confidence, set out to consolidate transportation agencies and redirect funding from highways to mass transit. He brought in outspoken critics of Moses and underestimated just how deeply Moses’ influence was woven into the city’s institutions.</p>

<p>Yet, Lindsay’s optimism quickly ran up against reality. Neither he nor his advisors fully grasped the extent of Moses’ legal acumen, institutional memory, or political connections. Moses was far from obsolete; he remained a sharp and resourceful opponent. When Lindsay’s administration tried to merge public authorities and shift funding priorities, Moses and his legal team pushed back, arguing that such changes would violate bondholder agreements and the constitution. While the press largely overlooked these legal arguments, Moses’ grip on highway planning and federal funding remained a powerful lever. Attempts to persuade him to step aside were futile. Moses made it clear he was motivated by power, not personal reward, and he had no intention of supporting reforms that would undermine his authority.</p>

<p>Lindsay’s circle believed they could soon topple Moses’ influence, but they misjudged the political landscape in Albany. Despite reassurances from Governor Rockefeller, they failed to see how deeply Moses and his allies were entrenched among legislative leaders and influential interest groups. At a crucial hearing, Lindsay’s proposal was blindsided by a coalition of political, financial, and labor leaders. The administration’s lack of preparation was exposed as Moses and his supporters systematically dismantled the plan, turning the hearing into a public defeat for Lindsay.</p>

<p>After this setback, Moses’ power began to ebb, especially as Governor Rockefeller started to distance himself. Lindsay’s moves to limit Moses’ influence, such as appointing new board members, were mostly symbolic gestures. While Lindsay’s reform efforts attracted plenty of attention, the real decline of Moses’ authority came from shifting alliances at the state level. This marked the beginning of the end for Moses’ era of control over New York City politics.</p>
