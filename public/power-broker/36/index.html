    This chapter discusses the vast scale and intricate complexity of Robert
    Moses’ post-World War II road-building efforts in New York City,
    spotlighting the Cross-Bronx Expressway as a central example. Unlike earlier
    road projects that carefully avoided established neighborhoods, Moses’ new
    superhighways plowed straight through densely populated urban areas. This
    approach forced the displacement of thousands of residents and required a
    complete overhaul of critical city infrastructure. The Cross-Bronx
    Expressway, in particular, became a symbol of this bold strategy, as its
    construction demanded cutting a massive trench through solid rows of
    apartment buildings and beneath crucial city arteries—a task that left even
    seasoned engineers in awe.

    The engineering obstacles were staggering. The planned route had to tunnel
    beneath the Grand Concourse, a major boulevard perched on a ridge and
    crowded with apartment buildings, a subway line, and a tangled web of
    utilities. All of these systems needed to keep running while construction
    was underway. Engineers faced the challenge of unstable Fordham gneiss rock
    and had to devise ways to support elevated transit lines and streets above
    the ongoing excavation and blasting. The expressway crossed more than a
    hundred streets, several railroads, and multiple major highways, pushing
    engineers to invent new solutions like “needle beams” and hydraulic jacks to
    keep everything stable. The sheer complexity of the interchanges and the
    unprecedented scale of the project meant that many components had to be
    custom-made, and new engineering terms were coined along the way.

    But the technical feats were only part of the story. Moses was relentless in
    pushing past bureaucratic and logistical barriers. He sidestepped red tape,
    secured enormous funding through bond issues and federal support, and
    navigated tricky real estate negotiations with powerful organizations. He
    took particular satisfaction in tackling physical challenges—sometimes
    choosing to move entire buildings instead of tearing them down—and seemed to
    enjoy outmaneuvering his critics, including environmentalists and community
    activists.

    The chapter places Moses’ work in a broader historical context, noting that
    authoritarian governments have often found it easier to push through massive
    public works by simply ignoring public resistance. While Moses operated
    within a democracy, he managed to wield almost unchecked authority,
    frequently putting his projects ahead of the people affected by them. He
    often brushed aside public protests, convinced that his vision served the
    greater good and would benefit future generations. Ultimately, the chapter
    suggests that, for all his technical brilliance and logistical skill, Moses’
    toughest battles were political. The democratic process, with its inherent
    checks and balances, made it far more difficult to carry out such sweeping
    changes to the city’s landscape.
