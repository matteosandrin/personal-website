    <p>In this chapter, the author details Robert Moses’ determined quest to take control of New York City’s tunnel crossings during World War II, highlighting his shrewd manipulation of politics, public opinion, and influential figures. Moses saw an opportunity in the wartime climate, convincing the federal government to stop tunnel construction by falsely claiming the materials were vital for the war effort. This move left the New York City Tunnel Authority in a vulnerable financial state—a situation Moses exaggerated to Mayor La Guardia, portraying the Authority as poorly managed and in need of rescue by his own Triborough Authority.</p>

<p>A key part of Moses’ plan involved undermining Ole Singstad, the Tunnel Authority’s chief engineer. Moses dredged up unfounded conflict-of-interest accusations against Singstad, even though several investigations had already cleared him. By spreading these rumors, Moses sowed seeds of doubt in the mayor’s mind. When a board seat at the Tunnel Authority became vacant, Moses took advantage of the commissioners’ indecision, quietly placing his own supporters in key positions and orchestrating a seamless takeover. With this, Moses secured a monopoly over the city’s bridges and tunnels, amassing extraordinary political and financial influence reminiscent of the old robber barons.</p>

<p>Once in power, Moses sidelined Singstad, using his engineering designs but denying him credit and excluding him from future projects. This effectively ended Singstad’s professional career in New York, leaving him isolated and resentful, despite his international reputation. Ironically, the tunnels Moses had once criticized soon turned into lucrative assets, generating profits that helped fund other city initiatives. Still, Moses continued to downplay their success, insisting they needed financial support from bridge revenues, which reinforced his own authority and narrative. Ultimately, the chapter exposes the sweeping impact of Moses’ ambition, shaping not only the city’s infrastructure but also the lives and careers of those around him.</p>
