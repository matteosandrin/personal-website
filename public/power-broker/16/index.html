    <p>This chapter explores the tangled and often tense relationships between Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Al Smith, and Robert Moses during a transformative period in New York politics. At the heart of the story is the uneasy alliance between Roosevelt and Smith. Although Roosevelt was essential to Smith’s political strategy—especially when it came to winning over upstate, Protestant, and rural voters—he never truly belonged to Smith’s inner circle. The social gulf between Roosevelt’s aristocratic upbringing and the more streetwise, pragmatic world of Smith’s advisers, including Robert Moses, created a persistent sense of friction. This divide comes into sharp focus in moments like Roosevelt’s discomfort with the flowery language expected in the “Happy Warrior” speech, which underscored his awkward fit within Smith’s team.</p>

<p>The chapter also delves into the escalating rivalry between Roosevelt and Moses. Both men were driven reformers with grand plans for New York’s parks, but their visions clashed. Their ambitions collided most notably when Roosevelt tried to appoint his trusted aide, Louis Howe, as secretary of the Taconic State Park Commission. Moses blocked the move, fueling a growing animosity between the two. Already a powerful figure, Moses repeatedly thwarted Roosevelt’s efforts to secure funding for the Taconic Parkway, instead channeling resources to his own Long Island projects and tightening his grip on state politics. These battles were about more than personal grudges—they reflected deeper conflicts over who would shape the future of New York.</p>

<p>As Roosevelt’s political influence grew, so did his rivalry with Moses. The 1928 Democratic convention became a pivotal moment. Roosevelt’s rising profile hinted at his eventual nomination for governor, a prospect Moses strongly opposed. Moses, who had once dreamed of the governorship himself, doubted Roosevelt’s abilities and made no secret of his hostility. Despite this, party leaders saw Roosevelt as the candidate best positioned to reach voters Smith could not. After some hesitation, Roosevelt agreed to run. With the support of advisers like Samuel Rosenman, he weathered a tough campaign with resilience and poise. In the end, Smith lost both the presidency and New York, but Roosevelt managed a narrow victory, becoming governor.</p>

<p>The handoff from Smith to Roosevelt was anything but smooth. Smith, eager to retain some measure of control, offered advice and pushed for the retention of key staff, including Moses. Roosevelt, determined to assert his independence, distanced himself from Smith and refused to reappoint Moses as Secretary of State. This sparked a public showdown and led to Moses’s resignation from that post, though he continued to wield considerable influence through his park roles. The inauguration was staged as a show of unity, but the underlying discord was clear—Moses even refused to take part in the ceremony. In the end, the chapter paints a vivid picture of Roosevelt’s resolve to forge his own path, the lingering power of Moses, and the complicated mix of ambition, loyalty, and rivalry that defined New York’s political scene during this critical era.</p>
