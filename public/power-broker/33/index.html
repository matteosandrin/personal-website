  <p>
    This chapter offers a sweeping, critical look at how Robert Moses rose to
    dominate New York City’s public works, urban development, and political
    landscape after World War II. Once a reformer with idealistic ambitions,
    Moses transformed himself into the city’s most powerful figure,
    orchestrating a vast network of influence that shaped New York’s
    infrastructure, politics, and economy for decades. By skillfully navigating
    legislation, forging strategic alliances, and manipulating finances, Moses
    consolidated power in ways that often sidelined democratic processes and
    public accountability.
  </p>

  <p>
    The postwar era brought a surge in federal funding for housing and highways,
    and Moses quickly recognized the opportunity. Drawing on his legislative
    expertise, he created new agencies and positions that concentrated authority
    in his hands. One of his most significant moves was establishing the City
    Construction Coordinator, a vaguely defined role that Moses molded to suit
    his needs. Through a carefully worded amendment, he gained the power to
    represent New York City in dealings with state and federal agencies, making
    himself the essential intermediary for all major projects. This allowed him
    to present his own opinions as those of the federal government, pressuring
    city officials to accept his plans or risk losing crucial funding. His close
    ties with federal road builders, whose priorities matched his own, further
    solidified his control.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ influence extended well beyond city government. When new mayors or
    governors tried to assert authority over housing or public works, Moses
    moved quickly to install loyalists in key positions, ensuring agencies like
    the City Housing Authority and the Mayor’s Slum Clearance Committee remained
    under his sway. Even powerful state leaders such as Governors Dewey and
    Harriman struggled to challenge him. Harriman’s efforts to protect local
    residents from disruptive projects were ultimately defeated by Moses’
    command of publicity, professional opinion, and administrative machinery.
    For a decade, Moses, without any formal ties, effectively dictated the
    city’s housing policy and urban renewal efforts, consistently outmaneuvering
    political opponents and preempting federal initiatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Central to Moses’ enduring power was his ability to reshape government
    structures to his advantage. He placed trusted “Moses Men” in influential
    administrative roles, ensuring his reach extended into every corner of
    decision-making. Secretaries and aides kept tabs on officials who opposed
    his projects, and he reorganized the State Department of Public Works to
    centralize control over the New York City-Long Island region. Moses secured
    legal veto powers for his commissions, rewarding loyalty with promotions and
    lucrative contracts, while punishing dissenters with career stagnation or
    undesirable transfers. Even as new governors took office, Moses retained
    decisive control over highway planning, construction, and the allocation of
    federal and state funds. He also exploited internal city politics,
    especially after the decline of the city’s Democratic machine during the La
    Guardia administration.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter then shifts to the resurgence of political corruption in New
    York City after the reformist La Guardia era. The once-powerful Manhattan
    Democratic machine, weakened by demographic changes and the loss of
    patronage, lost ground to boroughs like the Bronx and Brooklyn. The sale of
    Tammany Hall to a labor union symbolized this decline. Despite new
    leadership, the corrupt practices of machine politics returned, with public
    office once again serving as a vehicle for private gain. Graft became more
    sophisticated, moving from overt cash exchanges to hidden payments disguised
    as legal fees and retainers. Politicians received secret payments for public
    works contracts, making corruption harder to detect but no less pervasive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses, who had once refused to engage in political deal-making, adapted to
    this environment by paying whatever was necessary to get his projects
    approved. His control over agencies like the City Housing Authority, State
    Department of Public Works, and especially the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel
    Authority gave him access to billions in largely unsupervised funds. The
    secrecy surrounding Triborough’s finances allowed politicians to accept
    payments without fear of exposure, as audits were rare and the press, swayed
    by Moses’ reputation for integrity, seldom questioned his methods. This
    financial power, combined with the public’s trust in public authorities,
    created a system where deals and payoffs became routine and scrutiny was
    minimal.
  </p>

  <p>
    One telling example of how Moses’ discretionary power fostered corruption is
    found in the allocation of insurance contracts. Moses could award millions
    in insurance business without oversight, attracting politicians eager for
    financial gain. These contracts shifted with changes in political leadership
    and alliances, serving as a form of patronage that reinforced Moses’ network
    of supporters. He distributed insurance commissions and legal fees to key
    political figures across party lines, ensuring bipartisan backing.
    Legislative leaders openly demanded more business in exchange for political
    support, and even fellow Triborough Authority commissioners benefited
    through family interests. Legal fees were similarly used to maintain the
    loyalty of powerful lawyers with political connections, such as Samuel I.
    Rosenman and Monroe Goldwater. Moses never directly asked for favors but
    expected recipients to support his initiatives, as illustrated by Rosenman’s
    intervention with Governor Harriman. This careful allocation of financial
    rewards created a dependable network of political allies, reinforcing Moses’
    power over New York’s public works and political landscape.
  </p>

  <p>
    While Moses was not personally corrupt in the sense of taking bribes, he
    wielded financial influence to consolidate authority. He built a network of
    loyal supporters—people “on his team”—who were often on his payroll and who
    championed his proposals in government. The chapter introduces Tom Shanahan,
    a banker whose rise was fueled by the intersection of profit and politics.
    Shanahan used his banking connections to reward contractors with city
    contracts in exchange for political contributions and kickbacks, becoming a
    central figure in New York’s political machine. Moses and Shanahan’s
    alliance exemplified how money and influence shaped city governance, with
    Moses ensuring that Shanahan’s considerable influence served his own agenda.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses directed lucrative financial opportunities to Shanahan and his bank,
    Federation Bank and Trust Company, funneling large sums in deposits and
    securities that greatly boosted its assets and Shanahan’s wealth. In return,
    Shanahan wielded influence within the Housing Authority and Slum Clearance
    Committee, steering contracts and business to favored parties and ensuring
    that projects aligned with Moses’ interests. Political maneuvering was
    evident as Shanahan resisted oversight and demanded further power, while
    Moses protected and empowered him, even against mayoral wishes. Moses’
    broader strategy involved bypassing elected officials to deal directly with
    political power brokers, distributing favors and resources to secure their
    loyalty. This system of “honest graft” allowed Moses to maintain control
    over major urban projects and political outcomes for decades.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses ruled through a mix of patronage, fear, and strategic alliances. He
    kept detailed files on politicians, documenting favors and potential
    scandals, which he used to ensure compliance. Loyalty brought lucrative jobs
    and lifelong support, while dissent could mean lost opportunities or even,
    allegedly, interference with pensions. His influence extended to
    institutions, especially banks, whose financial interests he aligned with
    his public works projects, ensuring their support through mechanisms like
    revenue bonds. This blend of personal leverage and institutional alliances
    made Moses a dominant, nearly unchallengeable force.
  </p>

  <p>
    Banks, flush with surplus cash after World War II, were eager to invest in
    safe, high-yielding securities. Public authority bonds, especially those
    issued by the Triborough Authority, became highly desirable. Moses made
    these bonds even more attractive by maintaining large cash reserves and
    providing extra guarantees, ensuring bondholders’ security. His reputation
    for protecting investors’ interests led to rapid sellouts and substantial
    underwriting profits for banks. Moses deliberately set interest rates higher
    than necessary, resulting in windfall gains for bankers and making
    Triborough bonds the hottest investment in postwar New York.
  </p>

  <p>
    He arranged lucrative service fees for banks involved in bond transactions
    and deposited large sums without requiring interest, further benefiting
    them. By favoring private placements over open bidding, Moses ensured that
    banks with political influence supported his projects. These banks, in turn,
    used their clout to push political leaders to approve Moses’ proposals.
    Despite his general disdain for labor unions, Moses cultivated relationships
    with powerful union leaders, aligning their interests with his own to secure
    labor support for his projects. This alliance of financial and labor power
    was crucial to Moses’ ability to realize his ambitious plans.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also discusses the world of postwar construction, where union
    leaders and contractors depended on large-scale public projects for steady
    employment and profits. Moses was admired by both groups for his ability to
    secure and execute massive projects, ensuring continuous work and overtime.
    Contractors and unions benefited from Moses’ ambitious vision and his
    willingness to bulldoze opposition, seeing him as a champion of progress.
    The close, sometimes ethically questionable, relationships between
    contractors and politicians further illustrate the mutual interests that
    fueled New York’s postwar building boom.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ control over access to lucrative public works projects made
    contractors, architects, and other professionals dependent on him for their
    livelihoods. He used this leverage to secure political contributions and
    loyalty, offering patronage jobs and financial favors to the political
    machine. He also forged alliances with influential groups like the Catholic
    Archdiocese and major business leaders, exchanging favors and support to
    advance his projects. These relationships enabled Moses to mobilize
    political and economic power, ensuring his plans were realized and
    reinforcing his dominance over the city’s development.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter contrasts Moses’ top-down power with the traditional,
    pyramid-shaped political machine, where borough presidents and district
    leaders, though often corrupt, were ultimately responsive to public opinion
    because their positions depended on local support. Despite the flaws of the
    old system, it allowed the public to influence public works, highlighting
    the tension between centralized authority and grassroots democracy. Reforms
    that centralized municipal services and public works under the mayor and
    citywide agencies stripped borough presidents of control over jobs,
    contracts, and local patronage, undermining their political influence. The
    rise of independent public authorities, especially under Moses, and the
    city’s financial constraints rendered their authority largely symbolic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses filled the resulting power vacuum by offering borough presidents
    ready-made public works projects that promised jobs, contracts, and
    political rewards. However, accepting Moses’ proposals meant forfeiting
    input on project details or alternative solutions. When challenged, Moses
    wielded his control over funding to punish dissent, as seen when Bronx
    Borough President Lyons lost millions in highway funds for questioning
    Moses’ plans. Ultimately, borough presidents had little choice but to
    comply, lacking both the resources and authority to oppose him. Despite the
    appearance of democratic oversight, real power rested with Moses and his
    public authorities, not with the city’s elected officials or governing
    bodies.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Board of Estimate, made up of elected officials, was supposed to have
    significant control over land use and public works. In practice, though,
    Moses’ grip on funding and his strategic use of public authorities rendered
    these powers ineffective. He routinely bypassed or ignored the Board,
    presenting completed plans for approval without real input or modification,
    as seen with major projects like the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Unlike
    elected officials, Moses was not accountable to the public. He prioritized
    efficiency, engineering, and the interests of influential economic groups
    over democratic responsiveness. The chapter concludes that Moses’ dominance
    undermined the city’s democratic processes, shaping New York’s development
    in ways that would have lasting, even permanent, effects.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, the chapter paints a sobering picture of Moses’ thirty-four-year
    reign over New York’s public works. Economic interests—banks, labor unions,
    insurance companies, and big businesses—rather than the general public or
    elected officials, dictated the city’s development. Moses unified and
    empowered these forces, making them the decisive factor in shaping New York,
    while sidelining democratic input. The result is a powerful account of how
    one man’s vision and mastery of political and financial systems could so
    thoroughly reshape a great city, for better or worse.
