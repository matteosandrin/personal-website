    <p>This chapter delves into the intense power struggle between Robert Moses, New York’s legendary master builder, and Governor Nelson Rockefeller, whose extraordinary wealth and independence set him apart from any governor before him. Rockefeller’s vast fortune and family connections gave him unprecedented sway over state politics and financial institutions. He approached leadership with a mix of relentless ambition, a grand vision for public works, and a confidence rooted in privilege. Immune to the usual political pressures, Rockefeller proved to be a uniquely challenging opponent for Moses.</p>

<p>The narrative follows the shifting dynamic between the two men. By this point in his career, Moses was largely indifferent to political personalities, though he had a long history with the Rockefeller family. He had collaborated with Nelson and his brothers on major initiatives like the Palisades Interstate Parkway and Lincoln Center, building a foundation of mutual respect. However, as Rockefeller’s administration—steered in part by adviser William J. Ronan—began to assert control over areas Moses had long dominated, particularly parks and mass transit, friction grew. Rockefeller’s push for a more balanced transportation policy and Ronan’s increasing influence began to threaten Moses’s authority. Moses, already sensitive about his advancing age and hearing loss, felt the pressure mounting.</p>

<p>The conflict reached its peak over the question of whether Moses would remain in his state positions past the mandatory retirement age. Unlike previous governors who had routinely granted Moses two-year extensions, Rockefeller hesitated, eventually offering only one-year renewals. This move signaled his intent to bring about change and prepare for a transition to his brother Laurance. When Rockefeller suggested Moses would have to step down from his statewide chairmanship to receive an extension, Moses responded with a familiar tactic: he threatened to resign from all his posts. This time, Rockefeller didn’t back down. He accepted the resignations, catching Moses off guard and sparking a media frenzy.</p>

<p>The fallout marked a turning point in Moses’s career. He lost control over the Long Island parks and the State Power Authority, stripping him of much of his influence. Outwardly, Moses maintained his composure, but privately he was devastated, especially by the loss of the Long Island State Park Commission, which he considered his crowning achievement. The state’s decision to rename three parks in his honor was a bittersweet gesture, and Moses’s absence from the dedication ceremonies spoke volumes about his disappointment. In the end, Moses masked his resentment and made a public show of reconciliation with Rockefeller, signaling the close of an era and revealing both his political savvy and his ability to keep personal feelings in check.</p>
