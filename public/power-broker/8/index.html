    This chapter discusses the vibrant political scene of New York State in
    1923, focusing on the dynamic between Robert Moses and the Democratic floor
    leader James J. Walker. Walker comes across as charming and quick-witted, a
    natural politician who thrives in the spotlight. In contrast, Moses, though
    he holds no official position, proves indispensable behind the scenes,
    skillfully navigating legislative strategy and often serving as the voice of
    Governor Al Smith.

    The narrative paints a lively picture of Smith’s inner circle, where
    seasoned Tammany Hall politicians mingle with reformers, blurring the lines
    between policy debates and social gatherings. Smith himself stands out as
    both approachable and firm, a leader who commands respect while remaining
    accessible. Under Smith’s guidance, Moses picks up valuable lessons about
    the art of politics, especially the need for clear communication and
    managing the press.

    As the story unfolds, Moses’s confidence grows. He begins to move beyond his
    initial reformist ideals, adopting a more pragmatic approach to wielding
    power. His talent for drafting legislation and pushing through reforms—such
    as improvements in prison rehabilitation—sets him apart. By the end of the
    chapter, Moses discovers a new passion for public parks, a turning point
    that hints at the influential role he will play in shaping the city’s
    landscape for years to come.
