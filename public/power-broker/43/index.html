    This chapter traces the unraveling of Robert Moses’ Title I Slum Clearance
    program in New York City, spotlighting the crucial role investigative
    journalists played in uncovering corruption, mismanagement, and the
    devastating social consequences of urban renewal. The story opens with Gene
    Gleason, a reporter for the World-Telegram and Sun, who, motivated by the
    fallout from the “Battle of Central Park,” launches a deep investigation
    into Moses’ policies. With backing from his editors, Gleason pieces together
    scattered evidence—like the empty lots left after demolitions and the
    incentives developers had to stall construction—into a compelling critique
    that challenges the city’s narrative of progress.

    The chapter doesn’t shy away from the obstacles journalists faced. Gleason
    and his colleague Fred J. Cook ran into a wall of secrecy, as city
    officials, wary of Moses’ power, refused to speak on the record. Still, the
    reporters managed to reveal a pattern of abuse: developers such as Caspert
    and Company were profiting from the system while neglecting their
    responsibilities to pay taxes or provide housing. Even after their exposés
    made headlines, most major newspapers and city leaders, including Mayor
    Wagner, minimized Moses’ involvement and dismissed the allegations. Only
    when a major project collapsed financially did the city finally acknowledge
    the scandal, vindicating the journalists’ persistence and exposing the
    administration’s reluctance to confront clear evidence of wrongdoing.

    The chapter goes on to examine the political and financial forces that
    protected Moses and his allies. Despite growing media scrutiny and public
    outrage, Moses remained untouchable, thanks to his control over patronage
    and city contracts, which kept the political machine running. When the
    troubled Manhattantown project was handed over to Webb & Knapp, the original
    developers not only avoided punishment but walked away with generous payouts
    and promises of future profits. Although the city made minor changes in
    response to public pressure, the underlying corruption remained,
    underscoring the depth of Moses’ influence.

    A significant section focuses on Moses’ vision for Lincoln Center, a project
    that encapsulated both his ambition and the controversy surrounding his
    methods. To make way for luxury apartments and cultural landmarks, Moses
    orchestrated the displacement of 7,000 low-income families and 800
    businesses. Most news coverage ignored the human toll, zeroing in instead on
    financial scandals, such as the undervalued sale of land to favored
    developers and the expensive purchase of property owned by the Kennedy
    family. Federal officials, including Albert M. Cole, challenged Moses’
    tactics, but his political connections and support from influential media
    outlets like the New York Times allowed him to maintain his grip on power
    and funding.

    The chapter also delves into the personal and professional struggles of
    journalists like Gleason and Cook. They faced pushback from their own
    editors and were often shut out by city officials. Their stories were
    sometimes buried, and the myth of Moses as an incorruptible public servant
    persisted, making it hard to change public opinion. Despite these setbacks,
    Gleason and Cook’s dedication to exposing injustice inspired them to join
    forces with a new wave of young, idealistic reporters—Bill Haddad, Woody
    Klein, and Mary Perot Nichols among them. This emerging group, less
    intimidated by Moses’ reputation, began collaborating, sharing leads, and
    gradually shifting the tone of press coverage.

    The chapter ends with the unmasking of Sidney J. Ungar, a supposed anti-slum
    advocate who was actually a slumlord, and the growing momentum of
    investigative journalism. Energized by the determination of these younger
    reporters, the press brought widespread attention to the injustices of urban
    renewal. Their efforts marked a turning point, paving the way for greater
    scrutiny of Moses’ actions and signaling a shift in the city’s willingness
    to challenge entrenched power.
