    <p>This chapter follows Bob Moses as he evolves from an idealistic reformer into a shrewd political operator. Driven by his vision for ambitious public works, Moses gradually lets go of his earlier commitment to transparency and centralized oversight. He comes to understand that real power is essential if he wants to turn his plans into reality. To that end, Moses crafts legislation that appears to champion reform, but in reality, quietly hands significant autonomy to himself and the State Council of Parks.</p>

<p>Moses is careful to embed clauses that give the council chairman—his own position—control over crucial decisions like budget preparation, sidestepping the usual government checks. He also secures a long, protected term as president of the Long Island State Park Commission, ensuring his influence will last. Using vague legal language, Moses claims authority over large areas of land, including city-owned and underwater properties, and introduces little-known “appropriation” procedures to speed up land acquisition.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, Moses keeps his true intentions hidden from both the public and most lawmakers. He relies on inexperienced supporters to push his bills through without attracting attention or debate. In doing so, Moses quickly amasses sweeping control over New York’s park system, signaling a dramatic change in his style of leadership and his willingness to bend the rules to achieve his goals.</p>
