    <p>The chapter traces Robert Moses’ relentless, decades-long campaign to turn Flushing Meadows—a polluted, neglected marshland in Queens—into what he hoped would be the world’s greatest urban park. Moses’ vision, which took shape in the 1920s, was fueled by his conviction that only persistent leadership and steady, incremental progress could bring about sweeping public improvements. The narrative follows the evolution of his plans, the political and financial hurdles he encountered, and the way he used major public events, especially the 1939-40 and 1964-65 New York World’s Fairs, to push his agenda. Ultimately, the chapter examines the far-reaching consequences of his efforts, both for the park itself and for Moses’ own reputation.</p>

<p>Once a natural landscape, Flushing Meadows had become notorious as a dumping ground, famously described as the “valley of ashes” in The Great Gatsby. This blighted setting inspired Moses’ determination to reclaim beauty from urban decay. His ambitions stretched beyond Flushing Meadows, envisioning a network of parks that would serve New Yorkers for generations. Yet, his grand plans were repeatedly stalled by political opposition and chronic underfunding. The opportunity to move forward came with the proposal for the 1939-40 World’s Fair, which Moses seized as a way to secure legal and financial commitments for the park’s future.</p>

<p>Moses saw the World’s Fairs as springboards for lasting improvements. He made sure that investments in the Fairs would benefit the park in the long run. However, the first Fair’s financial collapse and the neglect that followed during World War II left the site in limbo. Undeterred, Moses kept his vision alive by capitalizing on opportunities like the United Nations’ temporary use of the grounds and various infrastructure projects. His focus remained fixed on the park rather than the Fair itself, a stance reflected in his resistance to expanding mass transit to the site. This decision, which limited access for low-income residents, revealed Moses’ particular vision for who the park should serve. He also used the Fair’s massive budget to consolidate his own power, awarding lucrative maintenance contracts to politically connected firms and blending public works with personal and political gain.</p>

<p>The chapter delves into the political maneuvering that surrounded the Fair, especially the distribution of commissions from mandatory insurance for exhibitors, which totaled more than $3 million. Political boss Carmine De Sapio used his influence to ensure that the agency Campo & Roberts, with which he was affiliated, became the sole provider. Despite Mayor Wagner’s objections and his refusal to play favorites, De Sapio’s behind-the-scenes power prevailed, highlighting the persistence of political patronage and the limits of reform-minded leadership.</p>

<p>Moses’ enduring clout in New York City politics is a recurring theme. The chapter recounts an anecdote in which Mayor Wagner, asked why Moses allied with De Sapio instead of him, quoted a satirical song: “Mayors Come and Mayors Go/But Old Man Moses, He Just Keeps Rolling Along.” This line captures the widespread recognition of Moses’ unique authority, which outlasted the tenures of elected officials. Moses’ alliances were pragmatic, based on who could help him most, and his influence was so great that even mayors and governors often had to accommodate his ambitions.</p>

<p>The World’s Fair became a tool for Moses to regain and consolidate power. He distributed contracts and fees to allies, encouraged lavish spending, and rewarded political insiders and public relations firms with generous perks. By inviting powerful contractors, bankers, and officials to share in the Fair’s benefits, he ensured their loyalty. While the Fair was supposed to serve the city, Moses managed to secure over $60 million in public funds through both open allocations and hidden contributions. Yet, the excess and favoritism that marked the Fair’s management ultimately damaged his reputation rather than restoring it.</p>

<p>Moses’ tendency to hoard power and responsibilities led to mismanagement. Obsessed with control, he refused to delegate or bring in experienced outsiders, relying instead on loyal but inexperienced staff. His lack of interest in the Fair’s content resulted in disorganized planning and a lack of architectural cohesion. By ignoring expert advice and giving exhibitors free rein, he allowed the exposition to become themeless and chaotic. His arrogance and inflexibility alienated foreign governments, leading to a boycott by major European nations and diminishing the Fair’s international standing.</p>

<p>The chapter also explores Moses’ fraught relationship with the press, which played a major role in shaping public perception of both the Fair and his leadership. Although he initially sought positive coverage, his hostility toward journalists soon turned them against him. Reporters, especially Joe Kahn, began to investigate and expose questionable deals and false claims about sponsorships. Moses’ combative approach only intensified the scrutiny and criticism he faced.</p>

<p>Financial mismanagement added to the Fair’s troubles. Moses’ optimistic attendance projections fell short, resulting in a 40 percent revenue shortfall and an inability to cover expenses or repay loans. His aides, afraid of his temper, delayed telling him about the crisis, and when they finally did, he responded by firing the messengers. Attempts to cut costs came too late, and efforts to hide the Fair’s financial problems from the public eventually unraveled. The appointment of outside auditor Henry J. MacTavish, who answered to Governor Rockefeller rather than Moses, revealed a $14 million deficit, prompting public resignations and more negative press.</p>

<p>As the Fair’s financial and public relations crises deepened, political leaders pressured Moses to step down. Despite intense efforts by influential figures and committees, Moses’ formidable personality and power kept him in place. The board, many of whom owed their positions to him or feared his influence, ultimately backed him. In the Fair’s final weeks, a surge in public interest boosted attendance and reduced the deficit, allowing for partial repayment of debts and some park improvements, though these fell far short of Moses’ original ambitions.</p>

<p>The chapter closes by examining the aftermath of the Fair. Moses’ controversial decision to prioritize park development over repaying debts led to legal disputes and financial losses for investors, further damaging his reputation. The personal toll on his family is also addressed, particularly the declining health and isolation of his wife, Mary, whose condition worsened as Moses faced public criticism and withdrew from the spotlight. After her death in 1966, Moses remarried quickly, marking the end of an era for both his personal and professional life.</p>

<p>In the end, the chapter paints a nuanced portrait of Robert Moses as a visionary whose drive to reshape the city was both his greatest asset and his downfall. His unmatched ability to marshal resources and wield power enabled him to achieve remarkable feats, but his inflexibility, intolerance of dissent, and entanglement in political patronage ultimately undermined both his projects and his legacy. The transformation of Flushing Meadows stands as a testament to his ambition, but also as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked authority and the complexities of public leadership.</p>
