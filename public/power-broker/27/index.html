    In this chapter, the focus shifts to a pivotal period in the 1930s, when
    Robert Moses’ relationship with political power began to change
    dramatically. At first, Moses saw power mainly as a means to realize his
    ambitious plans for public works. However, by 1936, his priorities had
    started to shift. His attempt to take control of the New York City Tunnel
    Authority, for example, revealed that he was now seeking power for its own
    sake, not just as a way to build parks or roads. When he was denied
    authority over the tunnel project, Moses didn’t simply walk away. Instead,
    he tried to undermine the project through legislative maneuvering, even
    though he actually supported its goals. This marked a turning point, as
    Moses became more focused on consolidating his own influence.

    As the Great Depression wore on, Moses became increasingly aggressive in his
    pursuit of control over new public works and housing projects. Although he
    had previously shown little interest in housing for the poor, the influx of
    federal and state funding changed his outlook. Sensing an opportunity, he
    secretly devised a plan to take over the City Housing Authority and launch a
    massive slum clearance initiative. Rather than working through official
    channels, Moses tried to sidestep Mayor La Guardia by presenting his plan
    directly to influential citizens and broadcasting it on the city’s radio
    station. La Guardia, however, was quick to respond. He cut off the broadcast
    and made sure Moses was kept out of any leadership roles in housing.

    The rivalry between the two men only grew from there. La Guardia went out of
    his way to exclude Moses from major housing projects, overseeing the
    construction of thousands of apartments without his involvement. This
    sidelining frustrated Moses and led him to criticize the mayor publicly, but
    La Guardia stood firm. He recognized that Moses’ ambitions were no longer
    limited to parks and infrastructure. Determined to keep Moses in check, La
    Guardia began slashing budgets and keeping a closer eye on his projects. Yet
    by this point, Moses had started to build his own base of power through
    independent public authorities, making him harder to control.

    Ultimately, the chapter paints a vivid picture of the escalating battle
    between Moses’ relentless quest for power and La Guardia’s determination to
    maintain democratic oversight of the city’s future. The tension between
    their competing visions would shape New York for years to come.
