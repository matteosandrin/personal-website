    This chapter paints a lively and detailed picture of the complicated
    partnership between New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and his powerful
    Parks Commissioner, Robert Moses, during the turbulent 1930s. Set against
    the backdrop of New Deal politics and rapid urban change, the narrative
    explores how their clashing personalities and competing visions shaped the
    city’s transformation. The story is as much about their personal rivalry as
    it is about the broader political forces at work.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the center of the chapter is La Guardia himself, a mayor known for his
    boundless energy and dramatic leadership style. He threw himself into city
    affairs, determined to root out corruption and inefficiency wherever he
    found it. La Guardia’s approach was often aggressive—he slashed city
    payrolls, cracked down on racketeering (even banning artichokes at one
    point), and demanded unwavering loyalty from his staff. For most city
    officials, his force of will was overwhelming. But Robert Moses proved to be
    a different kind of adversary. Unyielding and shrewd, Moses was one of the
    few people in city government who could not be bullied or controlled, and
    their relationship quickly became a focal point of city politics.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter dives into the explosive confrontations that defined their
    partnership. Their arguments were legendary, filled with shouting, threats
    of resignation, and even moments that nearly turned physical. Moses often
    used the threat of quitting as leverage, sometimes forcing La Guardia to
    back down, though over time the mayor learned to counter these tactics with
    humor. Their mutual dislike was obvious, even in the nicknames they used for
    each other, which reflected not just personal animosity but also underlying
    ethnic tensions. One memorable incident involved the sudden demolition of a
    popular ferry service between Astoria and Manhattan. Despite public protests
    and La Guardia’s plea for a delay, Moses pressed ahead, leading to a
    dramatic showdown where the mayor called in the police to try to stop the
    demolition. In the end, Moses got his way, showing just how effectively he
    could outmaneuver even the city’s top official.

    Another episode from 1937 highlights the intensity of their clashes. When La
    Guardia tried to reassign WPA laborers, Moses retaliated by closing
    playgrounds and removing equipment, sparking outrage among New Yorkers. Yet,
    for all their fierce disputes, their relationship wasn’t entirely
    antagonistic. Both men were deeply committed to improving the city, and
    their combined efforts led to remarkable achievements. Moses’ organizational
    skills helped turn La Guardia’s ambitious ideas into reality, and despite
    their frequent battles, they often found ways to reconcile and move forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses also understood the power of public relations. He played to La
    Guardia’s love of ceremony and spectacle, organizing grand openings and
    inspection tours that put the mayor in the spotlight. Events like the
    unveiling of the Thomas Jefferson Park pool became citywide celebrations,
    complete with parades and bands, reinforcing the image of a dynamic
    partnership and helping Moses push his urban projects forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    A significant source of Moses’ influence was his close relationship with the
    press, especially The New York Times. Through personal connections and
    generous hospitality, he secured consistently positive coverage, making him
    nearly immune to public criticism. Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, a key figure at
    the Times and a parks advocate, sometimes nudged Moses to moderate his
    ambitions, as in the case of preserving Central Park’s green spaces. Still,
    the paper’s unwavering support largely protected Moses and amplified his
    authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter wraps up by examining the structural advantages that allowed
    Moses to dominate city planning. With the federal government supplying most
    of the funding for public works and prioritizing projects that were ready to
    go, Moses’ control over planning meant that New Deal resources flowed mainly
    to his initiatives. This sidelined the mayor’s own priorities and reduced
    local oversight. Moses’ political savvy, patronage networks, and alliances
    with influential state legislators further cemented his power, enabling him
    to reshape New York City with little interference from either the mayor or
    the public.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, the chapter offers a compelling look at how personal ambition,
    political strategy, and institutional change came together to transform New
    York. Robert Moses emerges as the era’s most powerful and controversial
    urban planner, while Mayor La Guardia stands out as both his chief rival
    and, at times, his indispensable partner.
