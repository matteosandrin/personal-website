    <p>This chapter captures a pivotal moment in New York City’s history during the late 1930s, when the city was in the throes of transformation and debate over its future. At the center of the story is Robert Moses, whose sweeping vision for a circumferential bypass—encompassing the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, an elevated highway, and a parkway—sparked fierce political and civic battles. The narrative unfolds against a backdrop of limited resources, with city leaders, reformers, and ordinary New Yorkers all wrestling with how to balance ambitious development with the need to preserve the city’s character and meet basic public needs.</p>

<p>The action opens with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia working to bring Moses’ grand plans to life. Despite the scale of the proposal, the city was strapped for cash, and federal support was far from guaranteed. In a strategic move, La Guardia handed control of the Tunnel Authority over to Moses, trading it for access to surplus funds from the Triborough Bridge Authority. This shift in power enabled Moses to pivot from a tunnel to a bridge at the Battery, a decision he justified as both financially sensible and an opportunity to leave a lasting architectural mark on the city. Not everyone was convinced. City Comptroller McGoldrick, for one, sounded the alarm, arguing that Moses’ relentless pursuit of massive projects was draining the city’s coffers and putting essential services like schools and hospitals at risk.</p>

<p>McGoldrick’s concerns echoed those of other officials and reformers who saw the city’s basic infrastructure suffering, even as money poured into roads and parks. Schools were overcrowded and unsafe, and promised child care centers had yet to materialize. When Moses pushed for the expensive Circumferential Parkway, McGoldrick and two allies initially resisted, warning that it would max out the city’s debt and divert funds from more urgent needs. Moses countered with personal attacks and public pressure, while La Guardia, anxious to avoid a political rift, eventually convinced the dissenters to approve the parkway. This decision came at a steep cost: funding for schools, hospitals, and subways was sacrificed, underscoring the tough choices and political maneuvering that defined city planning at the time. The green light for the parkway, followed by the announcement of the Brooklyn-Battery Bridge project, set the stage for a fierce struggle over the city’s direction.</p>

<p>The proposal for a bridge at the Battery ignited a wave of opposition unlike anything Moses had faced before. This time, the critics were not just everyday citizens but some of New York’s most influential figures—reformers and wealthy elites with deep roots in the city. Their objections were both personal and civic. The bridge threatened to destroy Battery Park, block sunlight, lower property values, and cost the city millions in lost tax revenue. More than that, these leaders cherished the harbor views and the rare open space of Battery Park, a green haven at Manhattan’s southern tip. Their protest was fueled by a mix of self-interest and a genuine desire to protect the city’s unique character.</p>

<p>The chapter paints a vivid contrast between the crowded, shadowy streets of Lower Manhattan and the peaceful refuge of Battery Park. Skyscrapers had already swallowed much of the sunlight and greenery, erasing traces of the area’s rich history. Reform-minded elites, many descended from the city’s founders, mourned the loss of historic buildings and a sense of place. Yet Battery Park remained a sanctuary, a spot where one could escape the city’s noise and chaos, bask in sunlight, and connect with the past. The park’s layered history was embodied in Castle Clinton, which had served as a fort, an auditorium, an immigrant landing station, and, by 1939, the city’s beloved Aquarium. The threat to this cherished space made the battle over the bridge especially poignant.</p>

<p>The fight over the bridge marked a turning point in the relationship between Moses and the city’s Good Government reformers. Leaders like George McAneny and Stanley Isaacs, known for their integrity and commitment to public service, led the charge against Moses. Their principled approach stood in stark contrast to Moses’ increasingly heavy-handed tactics. In the end, the reformers’ efforts helped save Battery Park and preserve the city’s historic character, proving that determined public servants could stand up to even the most powerful figures.</p>

<p>As the conflict unfolded, the reformers discovered just how far Moses was willing to go to get his way. They were shocked by his dismissive attitude and misleading cost estimates for the bridge. Their investigation revealed significant omissions in his financial projections, including unaccounted costs for necessary connections and park restoration, as well as overlooked economic and social impacts. This realization forced the reformers to confront the fact that Moses’ methods and goals no longer aligned with their own values.</p>

<p>The battle over whether to build a bridge or a tunnel was intense and public. Reformers, bolstered by dramatic engineering renderings from Ole Singstad, tried to rally officials and the public to their side. Moses, however, moved quickly to push legislation favoring his bridge plan, effectively sidelining alternatives. Despite support from labor groups and some council members, Moses’ grip on funding left the city with little real choice. The City Planning Commission approved the bridge, acknowledging its flaws but citing the lack of financing for a tunnel. The reformers’ main plea was for a thorough, impartial study before making such a consequential decision, but their calls for caution went largely unheeded.</p>

<p>Despite their unity and determination, the reformers were ultimately outmaneuvered by Moses’ political power. His control over funding and his ability to pressure city leaders forced La Guardia to fall in line, even as reformers rallied civic groups, architects, and artists against the bridge. At a pivotal City Council hearing, reformers presented strong evidence that a tunnel would be cheaper, less damaging, and more beneficial. Moses, for his part, responded with personal attacks and deflected the criticism, refusing to engage with the facts. This episode marked a watershed moment, as the reformers finally saw the true nature of Moses’ leadership and withdrew their support.</p>

<p>Even as public and private opposition mounted, Moses’ authority remained unchallenged, and the legislative process was rushed through with overwhelming support for the bridge. Feeling powerless, the reformers turned to influential allies, including Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In the end, it was presidential intervention—citing military concerns about navigation and wartime vulnerability—that delayed and ultimately killed the bridge project. The tunnel alternative prevailed, much to Moses’ frustration, and he blamed the Roosevelts for the outcome.</p>

<p>The chapter closes with Moses facing new hurdles as he tried to complete the Belt System, particularly the missing Brooklyn highway link. Despite a $12 million funding gap and resistance from La Guardia, Moses’ Triborough Authority was forced to build the road without the financial benefits he had hoped to draw from the Battery Crossing. While the reformers celebrated what seemed like a victory, the author suggests the real lesson was the sheer extent of Moses’ power. Only the President could stop him, not the city’s elected officials or established institutions. This episode exposed the profound influence Moses wielded as the head of a quasi-public authority, raising lasting questions about power, accountability, and the true cost of urban progress.</p>
