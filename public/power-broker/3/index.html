    This chapter explores how Robert Moses’ postgraduate years at Oxford shaped
    his character, ambitions, and outlook on the world. Arriving at Oxford after
    graduating from Yale, Moses entered a university steeped in tradition and
    privilege, where a strong sense of public service was woven into daily life.
    Immersed in this aristocratic environment, Moses’ natural intelligence and
    idealism flourished, but so did his sense of entitlement. He quickly made
    his mark, becoming the first American president of the Oxford Union and
    leading the water-polo team, achievements that set him apart both socially
    and academically.

    Moses embraced Oxford’s flexible academic system, using his free time to
    travel across Europe and Egypt. These journeys expanded his worldview and
    helped him forge connections with members of the social elite. The influence
    of Oxford stayed with Moses long after he left. He adopted a casual approach
    to dress and developed an apparent indifference to money, both of which
    projected an air of upper-class ease. More importantly, his time at Oxford
    deepened his respect for British institutions and inspired his vision for
    American government.

    Moses emerged as a strong advocate for public service led by a highly
    educated elite, believing that the United States should model its civil
    service on the British system. He dismissed accusations of elitism,
    insisting that true meritocracy depended on intellectual excellence and that
    leadership should be reserved for graduates of the nation’s top
    universities. This blend of idealism and class-based arrogance became a
    hallmark of his public persona, evident in his controversial statements and
    his belief in limiting advancement to the privileged few. The chapter closes
    with Moses leaving academic life behind, ready to enter public service with
    the attitudes and ideals he had absorbed at Oxford.
