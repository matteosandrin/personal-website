    This chapter traces the dramatic rise of Robert Moses as New York City’s
    Park Commissioner, beginning in 1934. It paints a vivid picture of his
    sweeping reforms, tireless ambition, and the lasting changes he brought to
    the city’s parks and infrastructure. Set against the bleak backdrop of the
    Great Depression, the narrative shows how Moses’s vision and aggressive
    tactics reshaped not only the city’s physical spaces but also the way public
    parks were managed.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the moment he took office, Moses made it clear he was in charge. He
    quickly fired the existing borough commissioners and senior staff, replacing
    them with trusted allies from his Long Island team. This bold move set the
    tone for his administration: efficiency and loyalty were non-negotiable.
    Civil service employees who didn’t fit his mold were either shuffled off to
    less desirable jobs or pushed out entirely. Moses also brought in tough
    construction foremen to keep the workforce in line. He demanded results,
    believing that public money should be spent with strict oversight and clear
    outcomes. Moses even went head-to-head with the Civil Works Administration,
    fighting for the right to hire skilled architects and engineers at
    competitive wages. During a time when jobs were scarce, this drew a flood of
    talented professionals eager for work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite the punishing winter of 1934, with its record cold and heavy snow,
    Moses pressed on with an ambitious slate of park renovations. Thousands of
    workers labored around the clock, often moving faster than the architects
    could draw up plans. By spring, nearly all of the 1,800 projects were
    finished. The city’s parks were transformed with new playgrounds, fresh
    paint, restored monuments, and lush landscaping. For New Yorkers struggling
    through hard times, these revitalized parks became powerful symbols of hope
    and renewal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’s influence reached far beyond Central Park. He oversaw its
    restoration, refurbishing buildings, replanting gardens, eliminating pests,
    and adding attractions like the zoo and the Great Lawn. But he also
    recognized that many neighborhoods desperately needed recreational spaces.
    He scoured the city for unused public land—vacant lots, forgotten corners,
    and neglected parcels—and turned them into playgrounds and green spaces.
    Through savvy legislative maneuvering and by uncovering overlooked funds,
    Moses managed to create new parks even as the city’s finances were in dire
    straits.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of his most creative initiatives was the development of “War Memorial
    Playgrounds.” By redirecting money originally set aside for a war memorial,
    Moses established playgrounds across the city, each marked with a
    commemorative plaque. He acquired land from churches, corporations, estates,
    and philanthropists, often relying on clever negotiation or legal tactics.
    The rapid construction of fifty-two playgrounds, along with eight memorial
    sites, won him praise from both the press and the public, who were amazed by
    his energy and vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    A particularly touching moment in the chapter is the renovation and
    reopening of the Central Park Zoo in December 1934. Moses took on this
    project as a personal favor to Al Smith, the former governor and his
    political mentor, who had been sidelined by President Roosevelt. Knowing how
    much Smith loved animals and how disappointed he was with the zoo’s previous
    state, Moses made its transformation a top priority. He even diverted
    resources from other projects and worked through illness to get it done. The
    reopening was a festive event, designed as a magical zoo for children,
    complete with decorations, live animals, music, and a parade. Smith was
    honored with a medal and named “Honorary Night Superintendent,” turning the
    occasion into both a tribute to his legacy and a showcase of Moses’s
    commitment to public works.
  </p>

  <p>
    Smith embraced his new role with gusto, visiting the zoo at night,
    interacting with the animals, and entertaining guests with his playful
    antics. Under Moses’s direction, the zoo was completely transformed. The
    Arsenal was restored, new red brick animal houses were built, and whimsical
    architectural details and murals were added. Even with tight budgets imposed
    by the CWA, Moses and architect Aymar Embury II managed to create a charming
    and imaginative space that delighted visitors and brought people together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses believed parks should be places of enjoyment, not just awe. This
    philosophy was evident in the lively atmosphere of the zoo, with
    Sicilian-themed refreshment carts and a playful sea-lion pool. While some
    critics worried about animal care, the zoo was widely celebrated and drew
    huge crowds.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter then shifts to Moses’s next big project: the Triborough Bridge.
    Moses saw the Triborough Bridge as both a solution to the city’s traffic
    woes and a way to connect the Bronx and Queens directly, making it easier
    for people to reach Long Island’s parks. He faced major hurdles, including
    poor planning and political corruption within the Tammany Hall-controlled
    Triborough Bridge Authority. Moses quickly removed those responsible for
    wasteful spending, such as the unnecessary use of expensive granite, and
    redirected funds to essential infrastructure and park development.
  </p>

  <p>
    He assembled a top-notch team, including engineer Othmar Ammann and
    administrator Paul J. Loeser, streamlined the bridge’s design, and slashed
    costs by 40 percent. Moses also convinced federal officials to broaden the
    definition of “approaches,” which allowed him to use surplus funds for
    connecting roads and parkland. He overcame logistical challenges, such as
    securing land for the Queens approach and minimizing costly condemnations,
    and negotiated with Con Ed to build underground tunnels, which expanded
    parkland and made room for a massive stadium on Randall’s Island.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also discusses the controversy over the demolition of Calvert
    Vaux’s Ladies Refreshment Salon, later known as the Casino, in Central Park.
    Despite protests from park advocates who valued its historical and
    architectural significance, Moses insisted on tearing it down. His
    motivation was partly personal loyalty to Al Smith and a desire to erase the
    legacy of former mayor Jimmy Walker. A legal battle followed, but in the
    end, the courts upheld Moses’s authority, and the Casino was demolished,
    leaving behind only a few stained-glass windows as reminders.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, the chapter presents Robert Moses as a visionary but often
    heavy-handed leader. His relentless push for efficiency, innovation, and
    public benefit transformed New York City’s parks and infrastructure. While
    his methods were sometimes harsh and controversial, the results—revitalized
    parks, new playgrounds, a reimagined zoo, and monumental projects like the
    Triborough Bridge—left a lasting imprint on the city and its people.
