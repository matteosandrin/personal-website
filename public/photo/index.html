      <p>
        Since I was a kid I've enjoyed taking pictures, and I've been shooting
        on film since 2018. These photos were taken on either Kodak Ultramax 400
        or Kodak Portra 400 film, with either a Nikon FE or a Pentax PC35AF
        camera.

        This is a small selection of pictures I think turned out well. Enjoy!
