      <p>
        Since I was a kid I've enjoyed taking pictures, and since 2018 I've been
        taking them on film. All the photos below were shot on Kodak Ultramax
        400 or Kodak Portra 400 film, and with either a Nikon FE or a Pentax
        PC35AF camera.

        This is a small selection of pictures I think turned out well. Enjoy!
