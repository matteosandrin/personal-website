  <p>
    In November 2022, the MTA announced the discontinuation of the MetroCard
    from NYC subways. As a frequent subway rider, I had grown fond of its iconic
    design and felt a pang of sadness thinking it would be gone forever. I
    decided to manufacture a wall-sized replica of the MetroCard, in an effort
    to pay tribute to and preserve its timeless design.

    The “METROCARD XXL” measures a staggering 48in by 32in, fourteen times its
    original. The sturdy plywood base is finished with rounded corners and the
    iconic lanyard hole. Every detail is faithfully reproduced with multiple
    layers of spray acrylic paint, creating a flawlessly flat and industrial
    aesthetic.
