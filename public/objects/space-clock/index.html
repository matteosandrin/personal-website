    This object began its life as a General Electric model F1-8147 bedside alarm
    clock. When I found it on the shelves of a thrift store, I was struck by the
    space age look of its vacuum-fluorescent display and by the boxy 80s
    silhouette of it shell. Inspiration struck: this clock was destined for
    space. I pictured it at ease on the dashboard of the
    <a href="https://youtu.be/0ZoSYsNADtY?t=91" target="_blank" class="link">
      Pan-American Lunar Shuttle</a
    >, from the film "2001: A Space Odyssey".

    To bring this vision to life, the clock is stripped down to its bare
    components. Every button is cleaned and resoldered. The shell is sanded,
    primed and painted a lunar shade of white. The iconic NASA logo is carefully
    applied to both sides, while the alarm control switch is painted a vibrant
    red to match. Finally, the display rim and raised labeling are touched up
    for contrast.
