    Growing up in Milan, the Metro played an integral role in my daily life,
    shuttling me between home, school, and many nights out. I was fascinated by
    the distinctive signage that Bob Noorda had designed in the 1960s for the
    Milan Metro. A bespoke clock designed by Noorda himself could be found in
    every station, with its railway-style dial, bold sans-serif numerals, and
    chunky red hands.

    I found this clock delightful and nostalgic. Unable to find one for sale, I
    decided to create a replica of my own. Using an existing 30in clock as a
    base, the dial is painstakingly recreated with spray acrylic paint. The red
    hands are 3D printed, thoroughly sanded and coated with layers of durable
    enamel paint. The shorter end of the minute hand is filled with steel
    bearings, counteracting the weight of its 15in wingspan.
