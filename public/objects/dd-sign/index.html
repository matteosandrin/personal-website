  <p>
    I found this original Dunkin Donuts neon sign in an antique shop in Rhode
    Island, laying non-functional in a corner. It was originally manufactured in
    2009 in Virginia. I cleaned up the inside, dirty after years of outdoors
    service, and I redid the internal wiring from scratch. The sign originally
    came with cool white neon bulbs, but I changed them out for moody warm white
    ones.
