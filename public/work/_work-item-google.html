    I'm a software engineer on the Google Ads team, focused on hotels. My work
    revolves around building reporting features that help hotel advertisers
    understand their ad performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    I get to work on possibly the largest data pipeline in the world, processing
    billions of clicks, views and conversions per second. I also get to learn
    from some of the most accomplished software engineers in the industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my key accomplishments is designing and implementing a feature that
    provides advertisers with a clear view of their ad campaigns in different
    hotel destination markets. This feature allows advertisers to easily
    identify which destinations are not performing well, and optimize their
    campaings accordingly.

    Before that, I interned on the Google Flights team. Over the course of a
    summer, I and a scrappy band of interns redesigned and rewrote from scratch
    the frontend of the
    <a href="https://matrix.itasoftware.com" class="link" target="_blank">
      Matrix</a> 
    flight search engine. This search engine has a loyal following of over
    200,000 flight enthusiasts.
