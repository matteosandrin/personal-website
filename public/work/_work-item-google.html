    I'm a software engineer on the Google Ads team, focused on hotels. I lead development of new formats & improvements on the <a href="http://google.com/hotels">Google Hotels</a> ads booking module.
  </p>
  <p>
    I get to work on possibly the largest data pipeline in the world, processing
    billions of clicks, views and conversions per second. I also get to learn
    from some of the most accomplished software engineers in the industry.

    Before that, I interned on the Google Flights team. Over the course of a
    summer, I and a scrappy band of interns redesigned and rewrote from scratch
    the frontend of the
    <a href="https://matrix.itasoftware.com" class="link" target="_blank">
      Matrix</a> 
    flight search engine. This search engine has a loyal following of over
    200,000 flight enthusiasts.
