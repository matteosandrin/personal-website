      <p>
        I created this page as a place to collect every car I've ever driven,
        along with the stories, trips, and little quirks that made each one
        memorable. Every entry pins a moment in time (where I went, who I was
        with, what broke, what surprised me) while also documenting how
        different kinds of cars feel to drive. Over time, it becomes a way to
        trace my travels, my tastes, and the evolution of automobiles.
