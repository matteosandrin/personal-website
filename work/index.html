  <p>
    I'm a software engineer on the Google Travel team. I lead development of new
    formats & improvements on the
    <a href="http://google.com/hotels" class="link" target="_blank">
      Google Hotels
    </a>
    ads booking module.
  </p>
  <p>
    I get to work on a product with hundreds of millions of daily users. I run
    experiments every day to improve ad performance by a couple percentage
    points, which translates into large revenue gains. I also get to learn from
    some of the most accomplished software engineers in the industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before that, I interned on the Google Flights team. Over the course of a
    summer, I and a scrappy band of interns redesigned and rewrote from scratch
    the frontend of the
    <a href="https://matrix.itasoftware.com" class="link" target="_blank">
      Matrix
    </a>
    flight search engine. This search engine has a loyal following of over
    200,000 flight enthusiasts.

  <div class="text-sm text-slate-500">Software Engineering Intern</div>
  
  <p>
    Smartcar's core product is an API to remotely control any vehicle. Think
    lock, unlock, climate control, windows, etc. I reverse-engineered the
    Chrysler and Volkswagen Android apps, in order to figure out their APIs and
    integrate them into the core product. I spent many hours in the sunny office
    parking lot, remotely poking and prodding Smartcar's fleet of test cars.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smartcar was a small company at the time, no more than 15 employees. I
    enjoyed the challenge of working at an early-stage startup, doing everything
    from code to design to hosting a hackathon. I learned more in those three
    months about software engineering that I ever had before, and made some
    lifelong friends along the way.
