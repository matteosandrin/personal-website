  <p>
    In "The Majesty of the Law," the author goes into the ongoing struggle
    between raw power and the principles of the rule of law, centering its story
    on Robert Moses and his quest to build a state park system on Long Island.
    The narrative opens with a pointed quote from Commodore Vanderbilt: “Law?
    What do I care for law? Hain’t I got the power?”. The quote frames the
    chapter’s central question: What happens when those with influence try to
    sidestep or overpower legal boundaries? This tension runs throughout the
    chapter, prompting readers to consider how justice, governance, and public
    trust are shaped by the ways in which the law is applied—or ignored—by the
    powerful.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this philosophical starting point, the chapter quickly grounds itself
    in the practical challenges Moses faced in the early 1920s. With only a
    small initial budget, Moses set out to create a network of state parks. He
    wasted no time establishing a plush office, hiring friends, and spending
    freely on administrative costs, despite having previously criticized such
    patronage. When it came to acquiring land, Moses alternated between
    persuasion and pressure. He could be charming with cooperative landowners,
    but he didn’t hesitate to threaten lawsuits or use condemnation proceedings
    against those who resisted, as seen in his confrontations with the Rasweiler
    family. This mix of tactics reveals the complicated balance between Moses’
    personal ambition, political skill, and his willingness to bulldoze
    opposition for the sake of his vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Moses’ plans expanded, they began to clash with the interests of Long
    Island’s wealthy elite. One notable conflict erupted when Moses set his
    sights on land owned by members of the exclusive Timber Point Club. The
    club’s members, hoping to sell the property to select buyers, suddenly found
    themselves outmaneuvered. Moses, leveraging his authority, seized the land,
    brushed aside ongoing negotiations, and used threats of bad press and even
    eviction to intimidate the club’s leaders. The arrival of armed state
    troopers to enforce his decision drove home the point: power, when combined
    with political backing and media savvy, can easily bend legal norms.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter goes on to describe Moses’ even grander ambitions, such as the
    proposed Northern State Parkway, which would cut through the estates of some
    of the nation’s wealthiest families. Names like Mrs. Henry Phipps, Payne
    Whitney, and Otto Kahn appear, highlighting the formidable obstacles Moses
    faced. These landowners were stunned to find surveyors marking paths through
    their properties, sparking a series of legal and political battles. Moses
    responded bluntly, telling them that cooperation might spare their homes,
    but resistance would lead to land being taken right up to their doorsteps.
  </p>

  <p>
    Legal challenges soon followed, with critics focusing on Moses’ use of state
    law to seize land without proper negotiation or available funds. Despite
    intense lobbying and alternative proposals from the estate owners, Governor
    Al Smith ultimately backed Moses. The turning point came when one estate
    owner dismissed city visitors as “rabble,” a term Smith, who came from
    humble beginnings, embraced as a badge of honor. This moment reframed the
    conflict as not just a legal or property dispute, but a clash of class and
    public interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fight over the Taylor Estate became a drawn-out legal and political
    battle, threatening Moses’ career and stalling park development for nearly
    two years. The dispute played out in the legislature, the courts, and the
    press, with Moses and Smith casting themselves as defenders of the public
    good against privileged elites. Moses skillfully shaped public opinion,
    helped by supportive coverage from outlets like The New York Times,
    positioning himself as a champion of ordinary people—even as he pushed the
    limits of legality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite these efforts, Moses and Smith ran into serious roadblocks. The
    Republican controlled legislature refused to approve funds retroactively,
    and court hearings revealed both the lack of available money and the
    questionable legality of Moses’ actions. Legal delays bought some time, but
    ultimately the courts ruled that the necessary funds hadn’t been
    appropriated when the land was seized, casting doubt on the legitimacy of
    the whole process.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the chapter’s end, Moses faced mounting resistance from local boards,
    civic groups, and political bosses. Failed referendums and expired land
    options threatened to derail his vision, while private developers snapped up
    land at a rapid pace. It seemed as if Moses’ dream of a statewide park
    system was on the verge of collapse. Yet, the narrative hints that his
    relentless determination and political maneuvering were far from spent,
    suggesting that a dramatic turnaround was still possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, the chapter uses Robert Moses’ story to bring to life the
    complicated relationship between power and the law. It highlights the
    difficulties of making public policy in the face of entrenched interests and
    underscores the ongoing struggle to ensure that the law truly serves the
    greater good.
