  <p>
    This chapter explores the tangled and often tense relationships between
    Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Al Smith, and Robert Moses during a
    transformative period in New York politics. At the heart of the story is the
    uneasy alliance between Roosevelt and Smith. Although Roosevelt was
    essential to Smith’s political strategy—especially when it came to winning
    over upstate, Protestant, and rural voters—he never truly belonged to
    Smith’s inner circle. The social gulf between Roosevelt’s aristocratic
    upbringing and the more streetwise, pragmatic world of Smith’s advisers,
    including Robert Moses, created a persistent sense of friction. This divide
    comes into sharp focus in moments like Roosevelt’s discomfort with the
    flowery language expected in the “Happy Warrior” speech, which underscored
    his awkward fit within Smith’s team.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also investigates the escalating rivalry between Roosevelt and
    Moses. Both men were driven reformers with grand plans for New York’s parks,
    but their visions clashed. Their ambitions collided most notably when
    Roosevelt tried to appoint his trusted aide, Louis Howe, as secretary of the
    Taconic State Park Commission. Moses blocked the move, fueling a growing
    animosity between the two. Already a powerful figure, Moses repeatedly
    thwarted Roosevelt’s efforts to secure funding for the Taconic Parkway,
    instead channeling resources to his own Long Island projects and tightening
    his grip on state politics. These battles were about more than personal
    grudges—they reflected deeper conflicts over who would shape the future of
    New York.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Roosevelt’s political influence grew, so did his rivalry with Moses. The
    1928 Democratic convention became a pivotal moment. Roosevelt’s rising
    profile hinted at his eventual nomination for governor, a prospect Moses
    strongly opposed. Moses, who had once dreamed of the governorship himself,
    doubted Roosevelt’s abilities and made no secret of his hostility. Despite
    this, party leaders saw Roosevelt as the candidate best positioned to reach
    voters Smith could not. After some hesitation, Roosevelt agreed to run. With
    the support of advisers like Samuel Rosenman, he weathered a tough campaign
    with resilience and poise. In the end, Smith lost both the presidency and
    New York, but Roosevelt managed a narrow victory, becoming governor.
  </p>

  <p>
    The handoff from Smith to Roosevelt was anything but smooth. Smith, eager to
    retain some measure of control, offered advice and pushed for the retention
    of key staff, including Moses. Roosevelt, determined to assert his
    independence, distanced himself from Smith and refused to reappoint Moses as
    Secretary of State. This sparked a public showdown and led to Moses’s
    resignation from that post, though he continued to wield considerable
    influence through his park roles. The inauguration was staged as a show of
    unity, but the underlying discord was clear—Moses even refused to take part
    in the ceremony. In the end, the chapter paints a vivid picture of
    Roosevelt’s resolve to forge his own path, the lingering power of Moses, and
    the complicated mix of ambition, loyalty, and rivalry that defined New
    York’s political scene during this critical era.
