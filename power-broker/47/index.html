  <p>
    The chapter traces Robert Moses’ relentless, decades-long campaign to turn
    Flushing Meadows—a polluted, neglected marshland in Queens—into what he
    hoped would be the world’s greatest urban park. Moses’ vision, which took
    shape in the 1920s, was fueled by his conviction that only persistent
    leadership and steady, incremental progress could bring about sweeping
    public improvements. The narrative follows the evolution of his plans, the
    political and financial hurdles he encountered, and the way he used major
    public events, especially the 1939-40 and 1964-65 New York World’s Fairs, to
    push his agenda. Ultimately, the chapter examines the far-reaching
    consequences of his efforts, both for the park itself and for Moses’ own
    reputation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once a natural landscape, Flushing Meadows had become notorious as a dumping
    ground, famously described as the “valley of ashes” in The Great Gatsby.
    This blighted setting inspired Moses’ determination to reclaim beauty from
    urban decay. His ambitions stretched beyond Flushing Meadows, envisioning a
    network of parks that would serve New Yorkers for generations. Yet, his
    grand plans were repeatedly stalled by political opposition and chronic
    underfunding. The opportunity to move forward came with the proposal for the
    1939-40 World’s Fair, which Moses seized as a way to secure legal and
    financial commitments for the park’s future.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses saw the World’s Fairs as springboards for lasting improvements. He
    made sure that investments in the Fairs would benefit the park in the long
    run. However, the first Fair’s financial collapse and the neglect that
    followed during World War II left the site in limbo. Undeterred, Moses kept
    his vision alive by capitalizing on opportunities like the United Nations’
    temporary use of the grounds and various infrastructure projects. His focus
    remained fixed on the park rather than the Fair itself, a stance reflected
    in his resistance to expanding mass transit to the site. This decision,
    which limited access for low-income residents, revealed Moses’ particular
    vision for who the park should serve. He also used the Fair’s massive budget
    to consolidate his own power, awarding lucrative maintenance contracts to
    politically connected firms and blending public works with personal and
    political gain.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter discusses the political maneuvering that surrounded the Fair,
    especially the distribution of commissions from mandatory insurance for
    exhibitors, which totaled more than $3 million. Political boss Carmine De
    Sapio used his influence to ensure that the agency Campo & Roberts, with
    which he was affiliated, became the sole provider. Despite Mayor Wagner’s
    objections and his refusal to play favorites, De Sapio’s behind-the-scenes
    power prevailed, highlighting the persistence of political patronage and the
    limits of reform-minded leadership.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ enduring clout in New York City politics is a recurring theme. The
    chapter recounts an anecdote in which Mayor Wagner, asked why Moses allied
    with De Sapio instead of him, quoted a satirical song: “Mayors Come and
    Mayors Go/But Old Man Moses, He Just Keeps Rolling Along.” This line
    captures the widespread recognition of Moses’ unique authority, which
    outlasted the tenures of elected officials. Moses’ alliances were pragmatic,
    based on who could help him most, and his influence was so great that even
    mayors and governors often had to accommodate his ambitions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The World’s Fair became a tool for Moses to regain and consolidate power. He
    distributed contracts and fees to allies, encouraged lavish spending, and
    rewarded political insiders and public relations firms with generous perks.
    By inviting powerful contractors, bankers, and officials to share in the
    Fair’s benefits, he ensured their loyalty. While the Fair was supposed to
    serve the city, Moses managed to secure over $60 million in public funds
    through both open allocations and hidden contributions. Yet, the excess and
    favoritism that marked the Fair’s management ultimately damaged his
    reputation rather than restoring it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ tendency to hoard power and responsibilities led to mismanagement.
    Obsessed with control, he refused to delegate or bring in experienced
    outsiders, relying instead on loyal but inexperienced staff. His lack of
    interest in the Fair’s content resulted in disorganized planning and a lack
    of architectural cohesion. By ignoring expert advice and giving exhibitors
    free rein, he allowed the exposition to become themeless and chaotic. His
    arrogance and inflexibility alienated foreign governments, leading to a
    boycott by major European nations and diminishing the Fair’s international
    standing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also explores Moses’ fraught relationship with the press, which
    played a major role in shaping public perception of both the Fair and his
    leadership. Although he initially sought positive coverage, his hostility
    toward journalists soon turned them against him. Reporters, especially Joe
    Kahn, began to investigate and expose questionable deals and false claims
    about sponsorships. Moses’ combative approach only intensified the scrutiny
    and criticism he faced.
  </p>

  <p>
    Financial mismanagement added to the Fair’s troubles. Moses’ optimistic
    attendance projections fell short, resulting in a 40 percent revenue
    shortfall and an inability to cover expenses or repay loans. His aides,
    afraid of his temper, delayed telling him about the crisis, and when they
    finally did, he responded by firing the messengers. Attempts to cut costs
    came too late, and efforts to hide the Fair’s financial problems from the
    public eventually unraveled. The appointment of outside auditor Henry J.
    MacTavish, who answered to Governor Rockefeller rather than Moses, revealed
    a $14 million deficit, prompting public resignations and more negative
    press.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the Fair’s financial and public relations crises deepened, political
    leaders pressured Moses to step down. Despite intense efforts by influential
    figures and committees, Moses’ formidable personality and power kept him in
    place. The board, many of whom owed their positions to him or feared his
    influence, ultimately backed him. In the Fair’s final weeks, a surge in
    public interest boosted attendance and reduced the deficit, allowing for
    partial repayment of debts and some park improvements, though these fell far
    short of Moses’ original ambitions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter closes by examining the aftermath of the Fair. Moses’
    controversial decision to prioritize park development over repaying debts
    led to legal disputes and financial losses for investors, further damaging
    his reputation. The personal toll on his family is also addressed,
    particularly the declining health and isolation of his wife, Mary, whose
    condition worsened as Moses faced public criticism and withdrew from the
    spotlight. After her death in 1966, Moses remarried quickly, marking the end
    of an era for both his personal and professional life.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, the chapter paints a nuanced portrait of Robert Moses as a
    visionary whose drive to reshape the city was both his greatest asset and
    his downfall. His unmatched ability to marshal resources and wield power
    enabled him to achieve remarkable feats, but his inflexibility, intolerance
    of dissent, and entanglement in political patronage ultimately undermined
    both his projects and his legacy. The transformation of Flushing Meadows
    stands as a testament to his ambition, but also as a cautionary tale about
    the dangers of unchecked authority and the complexities of public
    leadership.
