  <p>
    This chapter explores the roots of Robert Moses’s character by examining his
    maternal lineage and the environment that shaped his early years. At the
    center of this story is Bella Moses, Robert’s mother, whose formidable
    intellect and determination were themselves inherited from her own mother,
    Rosalie Silverman Cohen. Rosalie, who emigrated from Bavaria, stood out as
    an unconventional and commanding presence. She cared little for traditional
    expectations of motherhood, preferring philosophical pursuits and speaking
    her mind without concern for social niceties. Her husband, Bernhard Cohen,
    was a gentle and respected civic leader known for championing public parks
    in New York, but he was often eclipsed by Rosalie’s dominant personality.
    This pattern of strong-willed women paired with more accommodating men
    became a recurring theme in the family’s history.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rosalie remained a force well into her nineties, impressing those around her
    with her sharp intellect and independence until her sudden death at
    ninety-three. Among her children, Bella distinguished herself not through
    beauty or a strategic marriage, but through her intelligence, kindness, and
    quiet strength. After marrying Emanuel Moses, Bella found life in New Haven
    stifling and eventually moved her family to New York, where she immersed
    herself in the Settlement House movement. Her activism was driven by both
    genuine idealism and a sense of superiority common among affluent German
    Jews of the time, as she worked to “Americanize” poorer Eastern European
    immigrants. Bella’s approach to philanthropy was hands-on and meticulous;
    she demanded the best facilities and personally managed projects, quickly
    earning a reputation for her assertiveness and exacting standards.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within her own household, Bella’s authority was unmistakable. She directed
    every aspect of her children’s upbringing, from their education to their
    social interactions, and insisted on a secular, ethical environment,
    steering the family away from religious traditions despite her husband’s
    preferences. The Moses children grew up surrounded by privilege and the
    comforts of New York’s German-Jewish elite, enjoying close family bonds,
    especially with their grandmother. However, Bella’s strict control left its
    mark: her daughter Edna became withdrawn, while her sons, particularly
    Robert, flourished under her demanding expectations. Robert’s personality,
    ideals, and even his mannerisms closely reflected Bella’s, suggesting that
    his later legendary drive and arrogance were deeply rooted in his maternal
    heritage. Ultimately, the chapter presents Robert Moses as the product of a
    family shaped by strong, intellectually ambitious women and the complicated
    mix of privilege, expectation, and personal will.
