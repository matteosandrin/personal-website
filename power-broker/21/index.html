  <p>
    This chapter discusses the tumultuous 1934 New York gubernatorial race,
    centering on Robert Moses’ unsuccessful bid for office and the tangled web
    of political maneuvering that defined it. At its heart, the narrative
    examines how ambition, ideology, and the pursuit of power collided among New
    York’s political elite during a time of sweeping progressive reforms and
    fierce resistance from established conservative forces.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1934, New York’s Republican Party was riven by internal conflict. The Old
    Guard, representing entrenched business and property interests, found itself
    challenged by a new generation of reformers led by W. Kingsland Macy.
    Alarmed by Macy’s progressive agenda and his efforts to nominate an
    anti-utility reformer, the Old Guard scrambled to reassert control. Their
    solution was to put forward a candidate who could project the image of a
    reformer while quietly protecting their interests behind the scenes. Robert
    Moses, celebrated for his work on public parks and civic projects, seemed
    the perfect figurehead. Although Moses publicly claimed he was reluctant to
    run, evidence points to his eagerness for the nomination, which was
    orchestrated by Trubee Davison, a well-connected member of the elite. This
    alliance with the very establishment Moses had once opposed underscored the
    pragmatic, sometimes contradictory, path of his political rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ campaign leaned heavily on his reputation as an idealist and
    reformer, but beneath the surface, he was closely aligned with the
    conservative Old Guard. He was willing to make concessions to powerful
    interests, such as rerouting parkways to avoid disturbing wealthy estates,
    even as he maintained a progressive public image. Most voters and
    journalists remained unaware of this duplicity, seeing Moses as a champion
    of reform, when in fact he had helped craft much of the anti-New Deal
    platform. This gap between perception and reality set the tone for a
    campaign marked by friction and isolation. Moses managed to alienate both
    young Republicans and former Democratic allies, running a campaign that was
    increasingly disconnected from the electorate.
  </p>

  <p>
    The campaign itself quickly unraveled. Moses, who had once enjoyed the
    support of influential figures like Aaron Rabinowitz and Henry Moskowitz,
    lost their backing by demanding loyalty that clashed with their other
    commitments. His relationship with the press soured after just one tense
    conference, and he made a critical misstep by assuming Mayor La Guardia’s
    endorsement without confirmation, prompting the mayor to publicly withdraw
    support. On the stump, Moses advocated for unpopular policies, such as a
    state sales tax, in areas where such proposals were deeply unpopular, and he
    openly criticized fellow Republicans, further alienating his base. Eschewing
    traditional campaign tactics, he limited his appearances to formal speeches,
    drastically reducing his visibility and failing to connect with voters.
  </p>

  <p>
    A particularly revealing aspect of the chapter is Moses’ fraught
    relationship with his Jewish heritage. Although he was Jewish through his
    mother, Moses went out of his way to deny this identity, sending his
    daughters to Episcopalian schools and making disparaging remarks about Jews.
    These statements offended many in the Jewish community, who saw him as
    having turned his back on his roots. This personal struggle bled into his
    political life, as Moses’ defensive and combative approach—repeatedly
    denying ties to the Old Guard and launching personal attacks on Governor
    Herbert Lehman—proved ineffective against Lehman’s reputation for honesty
    and public service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lehman, for his part, responded to Moses’ attacks with calm and focus.
    Rather than engage in personal mudslinging, he stuck to the issues and his
    own record. When Moses accused him of corruption and cowardice, the charges
    were either baseless or easily disproven. Moses’ rhetoric grew increasingly
    harsh, culminating in an accusation that Lehman was lying about milk price
    controls—a claim that was quickly debunked and even shocked Moses’ own
    supporters.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the campaign spiraled, Moses’ attacks became more personal and bitter,
    targeting not just Lehman but also former allies and, at times, their
    deceased relatives. Key supporters began to distance themselves, and what
    had started as a political campaign devolved into a series of personal
    vendettas. Only Alfred E. Smith, a former governor and friend, escaped
    Moses’ ire, though Smith’s refusal to endorse him left Moses feeling
    betrayed.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, Moses suffered a historic defeat, losing by more than 800,000
    votes—the worst performance by a major party candidate in New York’s
    history. His abrasive style and inability to connect with voters not only
    doomed his own campaign but also contributed to the Republican Party’s loss
    of both legislative chambers. The chapter closes by reflecting on the
    reasons for Moses’ failure: despite his political savvy and record of public
    achievement, his arrogance and disdain for others alienated the very people
    he hoped to lead. Ultimately, his downfall highlighted the limits of relying
    on association with popular causes rather than genuine personal appeal, and
    underscored the crucial role of character and connection in democratic
    politics.
