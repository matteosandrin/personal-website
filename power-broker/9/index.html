    This chapter traces the dramatic transformation of Long Island from an
    exclusive enclave into the centerpiece of a bold new vision for public parks
    and recreation. Set against the backdrop of New York City’s explosive growth
    in the early twentieth century, the narrative explores how shifting social,
    economic, and political forces shaped the fight for access to green spaces.
    At the heart of this story is Robert Moses, whose determination would
    ultimately open Long Island’s landscapes to the public.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story opens in the 1920s, a time when New York City’s population was
    soaring and undeveloped land within city limits was quickly disappearing.
    Reformers recognized the urgent need for parks, often described as the
    “lungs of the city”, but found themselves hampered by high land prices and
    competing urban priorities. Meanwhile, shorter workweeks and the rise of the
    automobile gave city dwellers new freedom to seek recreation. Yet, their
    options were limited. Westchester’s parks were off-limits to outsiders, and
    while the Palisades Interstate Park was technically open, poor
    transportation made it nearly unreachable. Overcrowding plagued the few
    available spaces, pushing reformers to look beyond the city for solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long Island soon emerged as a promising alternative. Beyond the dense
    neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens lay vast stretches of open land, shaped
    by ancient glaciers into a landscape of bays, ridges, and dramatic
    coastlines. The chapter discusses this natural history, but also highlights
    the social barriers that kept these spaces out of reach. Local baymen,
    fiercely protective of their fishing grounds, enforced exclusivity through
    leases and ordinances. Some farmers actively worked to keep city residents
    out of Suffolk County parks. Most daunting of all was the wealth and
    influence of America’s elite, who had transformed Long Island into their
    private playground.
  </p>

  <p>
    The book paints a vivid picture of the so-called “Gold Coast,” where
    industrial giants like J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller built lavish
    estates and surrounded themselves with luxury and privacy. These magnates
    wielded enormous power, using private guards, restrictive laws, and
    political connections to keep outsiders away. Public roads were neglected,
    the Long Island Rail Road was manipulated to discourage visitors, and nearly
    the entire shoreline was privatized. The few public beaches that did exist
    were overcrowded and uninviting, and even rare exceptions—a small beach
    owned by a generous widow or a federal lighthouse—were eventually closed off
    by legal or physical barriers.
  </p>

  <p>
    For most New Yorkers, the dream of enjoying Long Island’s natural beauty
    remained out of reach. With public parks scarce and access tightly
    controlled, families made do by picnicking in cemeteries or on farms.
    Reformers’ efforts to create public parks were repeatedly blocked by the
    entrenched interests of wealthy landowners, leaving advocates frustrated and
    discouraged. Even Robert Moses, who would become the movement’s leading
    figure, found himself drawn to the South Shore’s wild landscapes, a reminder
    of both the island’s allure and its inaccessibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’s curiosity led him to discover thousands of acres of woodland and
    water that Brooklyn had acquired decades earlier for water supply but never
    used. With official permission, he explored these hidden tracts and began to
    imagine them as vibrant public parks, filled with recreational facilities
    rather than just passive green spaces. His vision extended to the barrier
    beaches, including Fire Island and Jones Beach, where he saw the potential
    for a grand public bathing beach, accessible by a landscaped parkway
    inspired by the Bronx River Parkway.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Moses explored neglected estates and wild stretches of land, his
    ambitions grew. He envisioned transforming these spaces into parks with golf
    courses, bridle paths, and wildlife enclosures. Recognizing the shortcomings
    of New York State’s fragmented and underfunded park system, he proposed a
    sweeping plan: a $15 million bond for land acquisition and improvements, the
    creation of regional park commissions, and a central council to coordinate
    efforts. His approach blended conservation with recreation and, above all,
    emphasized accessibility for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter closes with Moses’s campaign to win political support for his
    vision. Although Governor Al Smith was initially skeptical, Moses’s
    persuasive arguments and the groundswell of public enthusiasm eventually won
    him over. Impressed by Moses’s relentless drive and sweeping plans for a
    network of parks and parkways—spanning forty thousand acres and 124 miles of
    scenic roads—Smith appointed him to lead the Long Island State Park
    Commission. In doing so, the chapter sets the stage for a movement that
    would forever change Long Island, opening its natural beauty to generations
    of New Yorkers.
