  <p>
    This chapter traces the poignant decline of Robert Moses, once the unrivaled
    master builder of New York, as he faces the erosion of his power and
    relevance in his later years. It opens with Moses grappling with a profound
    sense of loss and restlessness after being stripped of real authority.
    Despite his undiminished energy and ambition, those close to him worried
    about how he would handle the sudden inactivity, especially during the long
    winter months when his usual outdoor distractions were no longer available.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the narrative unfolds, we see Moses—who had once commanded the city’s
    public works—gradually pushed aside by William J. Ronan and Governor Nelson
    Rockefeller. They repeatedly stalled or dismissed his cherished projects,
    like the Sound Crossing, offering empty reassurances while quietly excluding
    him from meaningful work. His memos went unanswered, and former aides were
    told to keep their distance. The realization that his days of influence were
    over crept in slowly and painfully, leaving Moses visibly desperate as he
    tried, in vain, to reclaim some measure of relevance through the few allies
    who still respected his expertise.
  </p>

  <p>
    With his power slipping away, Moses found himself reduced to pleading with
    union leaders and contractors, who recognized his desperation. While some in
    the industry worried about stagnation without his leadership and continued
    to support him, political leaders remained unmoved, leaving Moses sidelined
    and humiliated. The chapter highlights the stark contrast between his
    imposing physical presence and his fading authority, as well as his struggle
    to come to terms with aging and the loss of control.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even as his hearing failed and the years caught up with him, Moses’s
    intellect and hunger for knowledge never waned. Surrounded by books, he
    turned his attention to literary criticism and continued to dream up
    ambitious urban planning schemes, such as a sweeping housing renewal plan
    that would relocate slum residents and create new developments like his
    proposed “Atlantic Village.” He mourned unfinished projects—the Fire Island
    highway, the Jamaica Bay Development—and grew frustrated that others
    couldn’t see the broader vision he had for parks and highways. His drive
    persisted, fueled by a sense of unfinished business and a deep belief in the
    transformative power of public works.
  </p>

  <p>
    Haunted by memories of his past achievements and convinced that the city was
    declining under new leadership, Moses tried various ways to regain
    influence, but each effort was rebuffed. He avoided writing memoirs, hoping
    not to jeopardize any future opportunities, and found little comfort in
    leisure. Restlessness and obsession with lost power became his constant
    companions. Though he still received respect from loyal associates and the
    occasional public honor—like a monument at Fordham University—these gestures
    felt hollow, as no major public work in New York bore his name.
  </p>

  <p>
    As criticism mounted and his reputation soured, Moses grew increasingly
    isolated. His brief foray into television fizzled, and as his circle of
    loyal aides dwindled, he was left alone, finding solace only in his
    grandson, whose sudden death devastated him. In the end, Moses’s
    accomplishments faded from public memory, leaving him bitter over what he
    saw as widespread ingratitude. The chapter closes with the image of a
    once-mighty figure now restless, isolated, and largely forgotten, his legacy
    overshadowed by the very city he helped to build.
