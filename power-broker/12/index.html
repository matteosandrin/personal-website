    This chapter explores Robert Moses’ complex journey as he masterminded the
    creation of New York’s state park and parkway system, focusing especially on
    the transformation of Long Island’s public spaces. The narrative follows
    Moses as he evolves from an idealistic reformer into a shrewd, sometimes
    ruthless political strategist, revealing how his ambitions were shaped by a
    mix of political alliances, legal battles, and unwavering vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the beginning, the chapter highlights the temptations that came with
    parkway construction. Politicians saw opportunities for personal gain
    through land speculation and lucrative contracts, thanks to insider
    knowledge of planned routes. Moses initially stood apart from this
    corruption, refusing to share information or make political deals, even if
    it meant delaying his own projects. However, after repeated setbacks, he
    realized that achieving his goals required building alliances. His
    partnership with Nassau County boss G. Wilbur Doughty marked a pivotal
    shift. After private negotiations, Moses secured the support he needed, and
    land deals began to benefit Doughty’s associates. This pragmatic turn
    allowed Moses to push his Jones Beach proposal forward, showing his
    willingness to adapt to the messy realities of political power to achieve
    his vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter goes on to describe the changing political landscape of the
    mid-1920s. Moses skillfully used his alliances and legislative know how to
    overcome resistance. When Nassau County broke with Suffolk in opposing the
    Long Island Park Commission, Moses seized the opportunity to exploit these
    divisions. Political pressures, including Al Smith’s run for governor and a
    crucial Senate race, forced Republican leaders to compromise, clearing the
    way for Moses to move ahead with the Southern State Parkway and other
    projects. Even as opponents tried to restrict spending and slow progress,
    Moses drew on local support, real estate interests, and creative financing
    to speed up land acquisition and construction, demonstrating his knack for
    outmaneuvering his adversaries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Legal and political maneuvering were also central to Moses’ efforts to
    establish Deer Range State Park. When local officials objected, Governor Al
    Smith used his charm and influence to smooth things over, while Moses
    delayed court challenges and pressed forward with development. Even when a
    court initially ruled against him, Smith’s extraordinary intervention as a
    witness turned the tide, and the judge ultimately sided with the park
    commission. This episode highlighted the imbalance of power between local
    opposition and the state, as well as the effectiveness of political and
    legal tactics in shaping public projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    The drawn-out fight over the Taylor Estate further revealed Moses’ growing
    ruthlessness. As his opponent, W. Kingsland Macy, racked up legal expenses,
    Moses continued developing the estate into a park, making it nearly
    impossible for the courts to reverse the process. This conflict not only
    raised Macy’s political profile but also taught Moses the value of bold,
    sometimes deceptive action. He discovered that starting physical work on a
    project made it much harder for opponents to stop it, and that
    underestimating costs could help secure initial funding and force further
    investment down the line.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter concludes with Moses’ bold vision for Jones Beach. He rejected
    the utilitarian and commercialized designs common at the time, instead
    imagining grand, architecturally striking structures like a water tower
    inspired by a Venetian campanile and innovative bathhouses built from
    expensive materials and designed to blend with the landscape. Despite
    skepticism from architects and resistance from legislators over budget
    overruns, Moses pressed on, using political support and strategic
    maneuvering to bring his vision to life. In the end, the chapter paints
    Moses as a complicated figure whose mix of idealism, pragmatism, and
    relentless ambition transformed public recreation in New York.
