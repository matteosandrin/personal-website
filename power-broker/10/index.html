  <p>
    This chapter follows Bob Moses as he evolves from an idealistic reformer
    into a shrewd political operator. Driven by his vision for ambitious public
    works, Moses gradually lets go of his earlier commitment to transparency and
    centralized oversight. He comes to understand that real power is essential
    if he wants to turn his plans into reality. To that end, Moses crafts
    legislation that appears to champion reform, but in reality, quietly hands
    significant autonomy to himself and the State Council of Parks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses is careful to embed clauses that give the council chairman—his own
    position—control over crucial decisions like budget preparation,
    sidestepping the usual government checks. He also secures a long, protected
    term as president of the Long Island State Park Commission, ensuring his
    influence will last. Using vague legal language, Moses claims authority over
    large areas of land, including city-owned and underwater properties, and
    introduces little-known “appropriation” procedures to speed up land
    acquisition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this process, Moses keeps his true intentions hidden from both
    the public and most lawmakers. He relies on inexperienced supporters to push
    his bills through without attracting attention or debate. In doing so, Moses
    quickly amasses sweeping control over New York’s park system, signaling a
    dramatic change in his style of leadership and his willingness to bend the
    rules to achieve his goals.
