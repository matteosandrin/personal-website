  <p>
    This chapter traces the interconnected rise of Belle Moskowitz, Al Smith,
    and Robert Moses as they helped usher in a new era for New York State
    government, blending lofty reform ideals with the realities of political
    life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Belle Moskowitz began her career as a modest social worker, but quickly
    proved herself as a force behind the scenes. Belle set herself apart by
    turning reformist ambitions into real results. Her efforts to regulate
    exploitative dance academies and her fair handling of labor disputes earned
    her a reputation for both effectiveness and integrity. These qualities
    caught the eye of governor Alfred E. Smith. Recognizing her talents, Smith
    appointed Belle as the executive head of a major state commission, a
    position that not only expanded her influence but also gave her the
    opportunity to bring Bob Moses on board as chief of staff, paving the way
    for his own rapid ascent. Under Belle’s mentorship, Bob Moses learned to
    balance his idealism with the practical demands of politics. He came to
    understand the importance of compromise, patronage, and alliances in
    achieving meaningful reform. This evolution is clear in Moses’s growing
    political savvy and his careful efforts to avoid embarrassing the Governor
    as he navigated the complexities of power.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter then shifts to the political environment Smith faced on his way
    to the governor’s office. Many reformers dismissed Smith as a product of the
    corrupt Tammany Hall machine, seeing him as uneducated and beholden to party
    bosses. Belle, however, saw something more in him. Although Smith was
    initially wary of reformers and skeptical about women’s involvement in
    politics, Belle’s strategic advice gradually won him over. She helped him
    reach out to newly enfranchised women voters and independent groups,
    broadening his appeal. After Smith’s unexpected victory, he leaned heavily
    on Belle’s guidance, including her recommendation to create a State
    Reconstruction Commission. This move was designed to attract progressive
    Republicans and divide the opposition, while also tackling the tangled and
    inefficient state government structure that Smith had inherited.
  </p>

  <p>
    As head of the State Reconstruction Commission, Moses brought relentless
    energy and high standards to the job. His staff admired his drive and sense
    of purpose, even as they struggled with long hours and limited pay. Moses’s
    demanding yet inspiring leadership style built strong loyalty among his
    team, and his personal vigor became the stuff of legend. Despite scarce
    resources, Moses managed to produce a comprehensive government
    reorganization report. The document stood out for its clear, passionate
    writing and its call for greater citizen involvement and stronger executive
    authority. While the report was widely praised as a model for modern state
    government reform, Moses’s insistence on sole authorship led to some
    friction with his collaborators.
  </p>

  <p>
    To turn the report’s recommendations into reality, a Citizens Committee was
    formed, with Moses serving as secretary. He expanded the committee’s reach
    by enlisting prominent members and securing essential funding, which allowed
    the group to operate independently and support Governor Smith’s legislative
    agenda. Smith’s persuasive leadership, combined with Moses’s technical
    expertise and Belle’s political finesse, helped push most of the reforms
    through the legislature, though some measures were blocked after Smith lost
    his re-election bid in a Republican landslide.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter closes with a look at the growing partnership between Moses and
    Smith, symbolized by their walks together through the Lower East Side.
    Smith’s popularity and openness to Moses’s ideas marked the beginning of a
    new collaboration between reformers and political leaders, setting the stage
    for future successes in New York State government.
