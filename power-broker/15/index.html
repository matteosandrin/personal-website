  <p>
    This chapter paints a vivid picture of the sweeping administrative changes
    that transformed New York State in the 1920s, with Robert Moses at the
    center of it all. The story opens with the political battle that led to the
    State Department Law of 1926, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that
    merged 187 scattered state agencies into just 18 departments. This overhaul
    didn’t just make government more efficient, it also gave the governor far
    greater control, setting the stage for real change. Governor Al Smith seized
    this opportunity, using the new streamlined system to push through
    progressive reforms: better working conditions, expanded public housing,
    higher salaries for teachers, and even lower state taxes. While Moses
    himself wasn’t driven by a passion for social welfare, his knack for
    administrative innovation was crucial in building the framework that made
    these advances possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ rise to Secretary of State in 1927 was anything but smooth. His
    nomination stirred up fierce debate among political insiders from both
    parties. In the end, it was Smith’s political savvy that secured Moses the
    job, highlighting both the contentious nature of reform and the lasting mark
    Moses would leave on state government. Once in office, Moses attacked
    corruption with gusto, particularly in areas like boxing regulation. He
    wasn’t immune to mistakes, especially when he ventured into unfamiliar
    territory, but his most important contributions often happened quietly, as
    he sped up major public works projects under Smith’s guidance—building
    hospitals, parks, and vital infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also offers a glimpse into Moses’ relentless drive and the
    personal sacrifices he made to keep up his extraordinary pace. He cut out
    nearly all leisure and social activities, leaving household matters to his
    wife and even arranging for barbers to come to his office. Moses squeezed
    productivity out of every moment, turning his car into a traveling workspace
    and holding meetings on the go. He depended heavily on his secretary, Miss
    Tappan, who ran his office with military discipline and was always on call
    thanks to a dedicated car and drivers. Moses kept his office running
    smoothly by refusing lunch invitations, installing a special phone system to
    minimize interruptions, and swapping his desk for a table to avoid clutter.
    Still, the constant pressure took its toll—his handwriting grew sloppy, he
    nicked himself shaving, and his temper became more unpredictable, sometimes
    boiling over in physical outbursts.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the narrative unfolds, we see Moses evolve from a sensitive young man
    into a commanding, sometimes intimidating leader. His impatience and fierce
    temper created a tense environment for his staff, though he remained
    courteous and even warm toward women, especially his secretaries. Water
    became his refuge; he sought out river views and swam daily to recharge.
    Moses had a keen eye for talent, promoted people quickly, and insisted on
    strict adherence to hierarchy, usually communicating with staff through
    memos.
  </p>

  <p>
    He demanded total loyalty and tireless effort from his aides, expecting them
    to be available around the clock and fostering an atmosphere where
    disagreement was rare. Moses personally trained his team, especially in
    communication, and rewarded loyalty with rapid promotions and creative
    perks. The pressure sometimes led to breakdowns, but those who stuck it out
    often found real pride and purpose in their work, helping to bring about
    major public works across the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter wraps up by highlighting Moses’ deep loyalty to Al Smith and his
    emotional investment in Smith’s presidential campaign. As Smith’s time in
    office drew to a close, Moses worked frantically to push his park projects
    forward, worried that a new administration might bring everything to a halt.
    This urgency, combined with his loyalty, reveals the forces that drove
    Moses’ relentless pursuit of reform and progress.
