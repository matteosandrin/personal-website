  <p>
    The introduction follows the life of Robert Moses, charting his journey from
    an idealistic young reformer to one of the most influential—and
    divisive—figures in twentieth-century urban America. It begins by
    introducing Moses as a promising Yale student, admired for his integrity and
    dedication to public service. Even at this early stage, however, Moses
    reveals a willingness to bend the rules, resorting to deception to secure
    funding for the swimming team. When confronted about his actions, he chooses
    to resign rather than compromise, hinting at a stubbornness and resolve that
    would define his later career. This opening story sets up the book's central
    theme: the ongoing tension between Moses’ lofty ideals and his relentless
    drive for power.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Moses moves from the academic world into public service, the narrative
    follows his first attempts to reform New York’s civil service system.
    Motivated by a belief in merit and fairness, he takes on powerful interests
    like Tammany Hall, only to be defeated and see his reforms quickly undone.
    These early disappointments teach Moses a hard lesson: good intentions are
    not enough without the authority to make them reality. This realization
    marks a turning point. Moses begins to shift his focus, embracing power as
    the essential tool for achieving his ambitious goals. His battles become
    less about principle and more about control, as seen in his later dealings
    with Mayor Robert Wagner, where Moses secures influential positions through
    sheer determination.
  </p>

  <p>
    The introduction then discusses the enormous impact Moses had on New York
    City and its surrounding areas. Over more than thirty years, he transformed
    the city’s landscape, building expressways, bridges, and massive housing
    projects like Stuyvesant Town and Co-op City. He expanded parks,
    playgrounds, and beaches, and played a key role in urban renewal—often at
    the cost of uprooting entire communities. Moses’ influence stretched far
    beyond the city, reaching into the suburbs, Long Island, and upstate New
    York, where he oversaw the construction of dams and the development of
    recreational areas. His imprint can still be seen across the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    Much of Moses’ power came from his control of the Triborough Bridge and
    Tunnel Authority, which operated almost like a city within a city, complete
    with its own revenue, police, and regulations. This independence allowed him
    to reward allies, sideline adversaries, and maintain an unchallenged hold
    over public works. He used the Authority’s secrecy and financial resources
    to hide waste and inefficiency, all while projecting an image of
    incorruptibility and effectiveness. In truth, many of his projects relied on
    public subsidies, and he built a political machine by handing out contracts
    and favors to secure loyalty.
  </p>

  <p>
    The introduction doesn’t shy away from the darker side of Moses’ legacy. His
    pursuit of power led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people,
    disproportionately affecting poor and minority communities, and contributed
    to urban congestion and social fragmentation. While Moses revolutionized
    parks, highways, and urban renewal—and inspired similar projects across the
    country—his legacy remains deeply conflicted. The introduction ends by
    asking whether Moses truly improved New York or simply changed it forever,
    leaving readers to ponder the complex balance between visionary ambition and
    the dangers of unchecked authority.
