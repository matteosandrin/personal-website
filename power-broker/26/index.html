  <p>
    This chapter takes a close look at the troubled and ultimately heartbreaking
    story of the Moses family, centering on the tense relationship between
    Robert Moses, the influential urban planner, and his brother Paul. Through a
    series of personal and professional clashes, the narrative explores themes
    of sibling rivalry, class attitudes, the corrupting nature of power, and the
    steep personal price of ambition and exclusion.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the core of the chapter lies the deep divide between Robert and Paul, a
    rift fueled by disputes over family inheritance and professional
    opportunities. Paul accused Robert of manipulating their mother’s will to
    cut him out of the family fortune and of using his influence to block Paul
    from city jobs he believed he deserved. While it’s impossible to verify
    every detail—key witnesses are gone, and Paul died before he could fully
    tell his side—the chapter presents strong evidence that Robert did, in fact,
    use his power to hinder Paul’s career, as several city officials confirmed.
    This unresolved conflict is portrayed as both intensely personal and
    reflective of larger questions about power and justice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite their differences, Robert and Paul had much in common. Both were
    bright, charismatic, and ambitious, shaped by the formidable women in their
    family, especially their mother, Bella. Yet their personalities and values
    couldn’t have been more different. Robert, heavily influenced by Bella,
    developed a patronizing attitude toward social class, seeing himself as a
    kind of benevolent overseer and reinforcing class divisions through his
    public projects. Paul, by contrast, was genuinely empathetic, treating
    people as equals and remembering the details of those whom Robert often
    overlooked. Their contrasting responses to their mother’s authority were
    telling: Robert learned to compromise and navigate political realities,
    while Paul openly defied her, even refusing a lucrative banking job arranged
    by the family.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paul’s independent streak led him down a less traditional path, including
    time abroad and military service, while Robert’s adaptability propelled him
    to the top of public service. Yet Paul’s idealism and refusal to compromise
    left him on the sidelines, unable to secure the public roles he wanted—often
    because Robert was working against him behind the scenes. Their professional
    rivalry spilled over into their personal lives, most notably in Paul’s
    ambitious but ill-fated attempt to develop a swimming club in Pennsylvania.
    The project, which seemed partly inspired by competition with Robert’s Jones
    Beach, failed without Robert’s access to state funds and political
    connections, leaving Paul financially ruined and further estranged from the
    family.
  </p>

  <p>
    The family conflict reached its lowest point after their mother’s death,
    when her will was read. Paul received only a small, restricted trust, while
    Robert and their sister Edna inherited the bulk of the estate. This decision
    devastated Paul, stripping him of financial security and deepening his sense
    of alienation and injustice. He believed Robert had manipulated their dying
    mother into signing a new will, motivated by his own financial needs. While
    some of Paul’s accusations were exaggerated or impossible to prove,
    interviews with relatives revealed that Robert’s influence had left a
    lasting negative impression of Paul within the family.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paul’s professional struggles continued as he tried to serve the public as a
    utility regulator, aligning himself with reformist mayor La Guardia. Despite
    strong endorsements and successful consulting work, Paul was repeatedly
    denied a permanent position, largely due to Robert’s opposition. As
    consulting jobs dried up, Paul’s finances collapsed, made worse by his
    lavish spending and failed investments. Mounting debts, foreclosure, and
    personal hardships led to the breakdown of both his finances and his
    marriage, leaving him destitute and disillusioned.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mismanagement of Paul’s trust fund only made things worse. Intended to
    provide him with a steady income, the fund was lost to bad investments and
    bank failures during the Depression. Paul’s efforts to recover financially
    were blocked by Robert, who refused to communicate or consider his
    proposals. The situation deteriorated further when Paul discovered that the
    trustees, including Robert, wanted to pay themselves commissions from the
    depleted trust. Legal challenges went nowhere, as his case was reassigned to
    a judge with ties to Robert, resulting in a ruling that mostly went against
    Paul.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the years passed, Paul became increasingly isolated and bitter, his
    personality changing as he fixated on criticizing Robert. Despite his
    qualifications, he couldn’t find work, likely because Robert controlled many
    engineering jobs in New York. Even when opportunities arose in his field,
    such as the St. Lawrence hydroelectric project, Robert never offered him a
    position. Paul’s later years were marked by poverty and loneliness, living
    in a cramped room with only his loyal companion, Millie, for company. His
    proximity to City Hall reflected his lingering desire to be involved in
    public affairs, though younger officials often dismissed him as eccentric.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also explores Robert’s relationships with other family members,
    particularly his sister Edna and his wife Mary. Despite Edna’s lifelong
    devotion, Robert kept his distance from her and the rest of the extended
    family, suggesting a deliberate effort to cut ties with his roots. Mary
    Moses played a crucial role in Robert’s life, managing their home and
    supporting his career. However, as Robert’s power grew, Mary became
    increasingly withdrawn, struggling with personal issues and the emotional
    strain of living in his shadow.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, the chapter paints a portrait of a family torn apart by
    ambition, rivalry, and the destructive effects of power. Paul Moses stands
    out as a tragic figure, a talented and idealistic man undone by both his
    brother’s interference and his own unwillingness to compromise. Robert
    Moses, for all his public achievements, emerges as someone who sacrificed
    personal relationships for power, leaving behind a legacy marked by both
    monumental accomplishments and deep personal loss.
