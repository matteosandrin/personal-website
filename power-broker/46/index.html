  <p>
    This chapter discusses the intense power struggle between Robert Moses, New
    York’s legendary master builder, and Governor Nelson Rockefeller, whose
    extraordinary wealth and independence set him apart from any governor before
    him. Rockefeller’s vast fortune and family connections gave him
    unprecedented sway over state politics and financial institutions. He
    approached leadership with a mix of relentless ambition, a grand vision for
    public works, and a confidence rooted in privilege. Immune to the usual
    political pressures, Rockefeller proved to be a uniquely challenging
    opponent for Moses.
  </p>

  <p>
    The narrative follows the shifting dynamic between the two men. By this
    point in his career, Moses was largely indifferent to political
    personalities, though he had a long history with the Rockefeller family. He
    had collaborated with Nelson and his brothers on major initiatives like the
    Palisades Interstate Parkway and Lincoln Center, building a foundation of
    mutual respect. However, as Rockefeller’s administration—steered in part by
    adviser William J. Ronan—began to assert control over areas Moses had long
    dominated, particularly parks and mass transit, friction grew. Rockefeller’s
    push for a more balanced transportation policy and Ronan’s increasing
    influence began to threaten Moses’s authority. Moses, already sensitive
    about his advancing age and hearing loss, felt the pressure mounting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The conflict reached its peak over the question of whether Moses would
    remain in his state positions past the mandatory retirement age. Unlike
    previous governors who had routinely granted Moses two-year extensions,
    Rockefeller hesitated, eventually offering only one-year renewals. This move
    signaled his intent to bring about change and prepare for a transition to
    his brother Laurance. When Rockefeller suggested Moses would have to step
    down from his statewide chairmanship to receive an extension, Moses
    responded with a familiar tactic: he threatened to resign from all his
    posts. This time, Rockefeller didn’t back down. He accepted the
    resignations, catching Moses off guard and sparking a media frenzy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fallout marked a turning point in Moses’s career. He lost control over
    the Long Island parks and the State Power Authority, stripping him of much
    of his influence. Outwardly, Moses maintained his composure, but privately
    he was devastated, especially by the loss of the Long Island State Park
    Commission, which he considered his crowning achievement. The state’s
    decision to rename three parks in his honor was a bittersweet gesture, and
    Moses’s absence from the dedication ceremonies spoke volumes about his
    disappointment. In the end, Moses masked his resentment and made a public
    show of reconciliation with Rockefeller, signaling the close of an era and
    revealing both his political savvy and his ability to keep personal feelings
    in check.
