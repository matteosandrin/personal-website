  <p>
    The chapter tells the heartbreaking story of East Tremont, a lively,
    working-class Jewish neighborhood in the Bronx, and how it was destroyed to
    make way for the Cross-Bronx Expressway under Robert Moses’ leadership.
    Blending personal stories, community voices, and political analysis, the
    chapter reveals the tragic fallout of urban planning decisions that put
    highways and infrastructure ahead of the people who called these
    neighborhoods home. Despite determined resistance from residents, their
    efforts ultimately fell short.
  </p>

  <p>
    East Tremont comes alive in the chapter as a self-reliant, tightly woven
    community, full of social, educational, and recreational opportunities.
    Crotona Park was the neighborhood’s heart, offering tennis courts, baseball
    fields, and a swimming pool where people gathered. Tremont Avenue boasted
    seven movie theaters, and the nearby Bronx Zoo and Botanical Garden added to
    the area’s cultural richness. The neighborhood supported active programs for
    seniors, affordable camps for kids, and schools with high standards and
    special programs, like violin lessons at PS 67. Families often lived close
    together for generations, sharing resources and looking out for one another.
    While there was some rivalry among different social, religious, and
    political groups, a strong sense of belonging and continuity held the
    community together. Outsiders like Moses dismissed the apartments as
    “tenements,” but residents valued them for their spaciousness,
    affordability, and character. Low rents made good housing accessible to
    working families, helping the neighborhood remain stable and attractive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet, many families in East Tremont lived on the edge financially. Most
    worked in the garment industry and struggled to pay even modest rents,
    always putting their children’s education first. With affordable housing
    scarce in New York and public housing hard to get, residents had few
    options. East Tremont played a vital role as a starting point for waves of
    immigrants—Irish, Italians, Jews, and later African Americans and Puerto
    Ricans—helping newcomers settle into city life and move up. Unlike other
    neighborhoods, East Tremont didn’t experience white flight as nonwhite
    families arrived. Instead, it stayed stable and welcoming, thanks in part to
    the liberal, egalitarian ideals of its Jewish residents and the physical
    buffer of Crotona Park.
  </p>

  <p>
    The same economic realities that kept families rooted in East Tremont also
    made them vulnerable when the Cross-Bronx Expressway threatened their homes.
    With affordable rents and no real alternatives elsewhere, especially for
    older residents on fixed incomes, moving out was nearly impossible. When
    eviction notices arrived, panic set in as people realized there was nowhere
    else they could afford to go. The so-called “orderly relocation” quickly
    turned into chaos, leaving families facing upheaval and uncertainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Displacement was traumatic and haphazard. Many residents ended up in
    temporary, poorly maintained apartments, often without heat, and were forced
    to move again and again as demolition advanced. The city’s Tenant Relocation
    Bureau offered little help, steering people toward unaffordable or
    substandard housing and showing little concern for their plight. Still,
    residents clung to hope, believing that Moses might consider an alternate
    route if presented with a better option. Their optimism grew when an
    engineer confirmed such a route was possible, but city officials quickly
    shut down further discussion. The pain caused by these urban renewal
    policies was matched only by the community’s determined, if ultimately
    unsuccessful, fight to save their homes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Led by Lillian Edelstein, residents formed the East Tremont Neighborhood
    Association (ETNA) and won support from local politicians and city
    officials, who at first seemed sympathetic and even promised formal studies
    and opposition to the original route. Engineering studies backed an
    alternate plan that would have saved more than 1,500 apartments without
    sacrificing the expressway’s efficiency. But Moses responded with threats
    and appeals to the greater public good, brushing aside local suffering and
    political resistance. Residents, buoyed by political backing, attended a
    crucial Board of Estimate meeting, only to find that Moses still held sway
    over the process.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hopes were dashed when their borough president, Lyons, secretly sided with
    Moses. The Board approved the expressway’s original route, ignoring
    alternative proposals and public protests. Lacking the money for a legal
    battle, the community’s efforts were stymied by poverty and political
    indifference. Edelstein kept fighting, gathering evidence and advocating for
    a less destructive route, but to no avail. Media coverage was limited and
    often slanted, and politicians like Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who had promised
    support, ultimately caved to Moses’ pressure after becoming mayor.
  </p>

  <p>
    The political process was riddled with manipulation and power imbalances.
    Deputy Mayor Epstein, initially sympathetic, was eventually pressured into
    backing Moses. The tenants’ attempts to present an alternative route were
    repeatedly undermined, with city engineers refusing to give their proposal a
    fair hearing and even excluding their court reporter from key meetings.
    Despite heartfelt appeals and clear evidence of unfairness, the Board of
    Estimate pressed ahead with the original plan, disregarding the tenants’
    concerns.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Board’s final decision to approve the controversial route left residents
    feeling betrayed, especially by Wagner, who had promised not to support the
    plan without proper relocation measures. The city handed the relocation
    process to Nassau Management, a private firm with close ties to Moses’
    aides, promising minimal hardship. In reality, Nassau profited handsomely
    from the upheaval, highlighting the tangled relationship between power,
    profit, and urban planning in mid-century New York.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter draws a poignant parallel to "Fiddler on the Roof," capturing
    the sense of powerlessness, endurance, and faith that defined the residents’
    experience. Systematic obstacles—from inaccessible management offices to
    deteriorating building conditions and constant threats of eviction—forced
    most families to leave. Elderly residents suffered the most, as city housing
    policies failed to meet their needs, leading to fear, isolation, and a rapid
    exodus. The process of eviction and demolition was chaotic and traumatic,
    with families enduring dangerous conditions, vandalism, and crime, while
    city agencies offered little protection or support. In the end, threats and
    neglect drove nearly everyone out, with 90 percent of residents relocated
    within ten months.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, the chapter offers a powerful and deeply human account of East
    Tremont’s destruction. It highlights the devastating impact of urban renewal
    on established communities, the resilience and solidarity of the people who
    lived there, and the overwhelming power of entrenched political and economic
    interests. Through the story of East Tremont, the chapter delivers a sharp
    critique of mid-century urban planning and a moving reminder of the human
    cost of so-called progress.
