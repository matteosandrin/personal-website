  <p>
    The chapter discusses New York City’s transportation crisis after World War
    II, spotlighting the explosive return of automobile traffic and the city’s
    attempts to cope under Robert Moses’s leadership. As the war ended,
    congestion in New York quickly rebounded to prewar levels, catching city
    officials off guard. The press was quick to criticize them for not using the
    quieter wartime years to tackle these problems. In response, Moses defended
    the city’s record, pointing to a slew of ongoing and planned
    projects—expressways, bridges, tunnels, and expanded parking—as proof that
    relief was on the way. Yet, the chapter makes clear that these ambitious
    efforts were deeply flawed. Instead of solving the crisis, they often made
    it worse.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’s postwar strategy centered almost entirely on building highways. He
    pushed for wider boulevards and parkways, nearly two hundred miles of new
    expressways, and major new bridges and tunnels. This marked a sharp shift
    from his earlier focus on parks and recreation, and it drew growing
    criticism from urban planners. They argued that adding more roads simply
    attracted more cars, creating a vicious cycle of congestion. At the same
    time, Moses’s projects neglected—and sometimes actively dismantled—public
    transit systems like trolley lines and elevated trains. This left New
    Yorkers with fewer transportation choices and encouraged the spread of
    car-dependent suburbs, a stark contrast to the dense, transit-friendly
    neighborhoods shaped by the city’s subway system.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also explores the broader social and economic fallout from
    Moses’s policies. By prioritizing highways and parkways, often at the
    expense of commercial traffic and industrial zoning, Moses inadvertently
    stunted industrial growth on Long Island. Jobs failed to keep pace with the
    booming population, forcing many residents to commute into the city and
    straining the already overburdened roads. Parking and street space quickly
    proved inadequate for the flood of new cars. Meanwhile, public funds flowed
    disproportionately to projects that benefited drivers, leaving subway and
    bus riders—often poorer New Yorkers—facing higher costs and longer commutes.
    This deepened social divides, limiting affordable housing options for those
    without cars. The chapter argues that only major investment in mass transit
    could have addressed these challenges, but Moses’s dominance in public
    debate and funding decisions kept such solutions off the table.
  </p>

  <p>
    Initially, the public was enthusiastic about the postwar road-building boom,
    with little awareness of the potential downsides. Critics like Lewis Mumford
    warned that highways were being built without proper planning, but doubted
    the public would recognize the dangers until it was too late. As traffic
    jams worsened, some New Yorkers began to question the wisdom of endless road
    expansion, floating ideas like banning private cars from Manhattan. Urban
    planners pushed for integrating mass transit into new highway projects,
    stressing that the window to secure land for such improvements was closing
    fast. Despite the practicality of these proposals, Moses dismissed them,
    missing a crucial opportunity to coordinate road and transit planning—a
    decision that would have lasting negative effects.
  </p>

  <p>
    To illustrate the pitfalls of this approach, the chapter examines the Van
    Wyck Expressway and its connection to Idlewild Airport. Experts argued that
    extending subway lines alongside the new expressway would have provided far
    greater capacity and reliability at a reasonable cost. Not only would this
    have improved airport access, but it would have helped address the city’s
    broader transportation needs. Moses, however, excluded mass transit from his
    plans, focusing instead on highways that primarily served wealthier
    residents and ignoring the wider social impact. Efforts to advocate for
    transit integration were stifled, as seen in the resignation of planner F.
    D. McHugh after his proposals were rejected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite mounting evidence that the highway-centric approach was failing—such
    as the Van Wyck’s immediate congestion and chaos at Idlewild—Moses refused
    to reconsider his policies. New roads and tunnels, like the Brooklyn-Battery
    Tunnel, quickly became overwhelmed, repeating the same cycle: each new
    project briefly raised hopes, only to be swamped by traffic. Public
    frustration grew, and experts increasingly called for investment in mass
    transit and pedestrian spaces, but the city’s leadership and media largely
    stuck with Moses’s vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the early 1950s, reports from groups like the Regional Plan Association
    highlighted the surge in car commuting and worsening congestion, urging a
    shift from road-building to rail investment. Still, Moses’s influence
    ensured these recommendations were ignored. The city became ever more
    dominated by cars, with quality of life suffering as a result. While the
    financial success of bridges and tunnels was celebrated, the human
    costs—displacement and social upheaval—were mostly overlooked. Moses’s grip
    on power remained firm, shaping New York’s future for decades to come.
