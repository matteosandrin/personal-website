  <p>
    This chapter takes a deep dive into Robert Moses’ sweeping and often
    contentious impact on New York City, moving well beyond his famous highway
    projects to explore his role in housing, slum clearance, and urban renewal.
    Drawing on case studies, firsthand accounts, and investigative journalism,
    the chapter lays bare the complicated and frequently troubling effects of
    Moses’ policies, especially for the city’s most vulnerable residents.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story opens with a growing wave of doubt among reformers and city
    planners about the ethics and effectiveness of Moses’ slum clearance
    efforts. People like Hortense Gabel and Lawrence Orton, who spent time in
    affected neighborhoods and scrutinized official data, began to notice a
    troubling pattern: instead of improving lives, these projects often pushed
    families into even worse situations. Gabel’s visits to Title I sites
    revealed that, far from revitalizing neighborhoods, slum clearance often
    left families in more desperate circumstances. Orton, meanwhile, uncovered
    that relocation statistics were being manipulated—public housing vacancies
    were counted multiple times, creating the illusion that displaced families
    were being properly rehoused. Walter Fried’s observations in his own
    neighborhood painted a similar picture, with signs of decline like
    overcrowding and the conversion of single-family homes into tenements
    becoming increasingly common.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter zooms in on the Manhattantown urban renewal project on the West
    Side in the early 1950s, a case that came to symbolize the broader failures
    of Moses’ approach. Here, thousands of poor, mostly Black and Puerto Rican
    families were uprooted and pushed into already overcrowded, deteriorating
    neighborhoods. Instead of eliminating slums, the project simply spread
    blight and created new pockets of poverty. With the press largely silent,
    reformers and concerned citizens took it upon themselves to document the
    fallout, gathering evidence of the worsening conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Orton and his colleagues at the City Planning Commission launched a quiet
    but thorough investigation, working out of sight of Moses. They estimated
    that at least 170,000 people—mainly low-income and nonwhite—had been
    displaced in just seven years, though the real number was likely higher due
    to incomplete records and data manipulation. Their findings were grim: most
    displaced families never received the promised help or access to public
    housing. Instead, they disappeared into overcrowded slums or contributed to
    the creation of new ones. The report warned that unless relocation practices
    changed, urban renewal would only deepen the city’s problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Women’s City Club, initially moderate in its reform efforts, conducted
    its own study of Manhattantown. Their findings challenged common
    stereotypes: many slum residents kept tidy, stable homes and had strong
    community ties. The neighborhood, though poor, was racially integrated and
    offered affordable rents and a sense of belonging. The club’s investigation
    highlighted the deep anxiety among residents facing displacement, who saw
    few alternatives because of barriers like race, poverty, and family size.
    Their work underscored the helplessness of the poor and fueled outrage over
    Moses’ relocation policies, which failed to offer decent, affordable
    options.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter doesn’t shy away from the harsh realities faced by families
    evicted for redevelopment. Despite Moses’ public promises of preferential
    treatment and new housing, displaced residents were often discouraged from
    applying, faced rents they couldn’t afford, and received little to no help
    finding new homes. Many ended up in even worse conditions—damp basements,
    overcrowded tenements, and vermin-infested buildings—paying more for less
    and suffering from isolation and declining living standards. The Women’s
    City Club’s documentation of these hardships was often suppressed or
    rewritten by Moses and his allies, who manipulated official reports to paint
    a rosier picture.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, the press, largely under Moses’ sway, failed to dig into the real
    story behind urban renewal. Even when federal investigations uncovered
    profiteering and corruption—developers snapping up city property at bargain
    prices and failing to deliver on their promises—the press steered clear of
    implicating Moses and let the story fade. As a result, Moses’ reputation as
    a benevolent city builder endured, despite mounting evidence to the
    contrary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter closes with a look at Moses’ life, tracing his path from his
    family background and Yale education to his rise as a powerful public
    figure. This more personal portrait stands in stark contrast to the accounts
    of suffering caused by his policies, highlighting the complexity of his
    legacy: a visionary who transformed New York, but often at a steep human
    cost.
