  <p>
    This chapter paints a vivid and complex picture of Robert Moses at the peak
    of his influence, capturing both the vast scale of his accomplishments and
    the troubling aspects of his leadership. Moses is depicted as the undisputed
    ruler of his self-fashioned “Triborough empire,” exercising such absolute
    control that board meetings and oversight became little more than empty
    rituals. Driven by an unquenchable thirst for achievement and the power it
    brought, Moses poured every ounce of energy into his work. His daily life
    was a whirlwind: he left all household matters to his wife, worked late into
    the night drafting endless memos, and even turned his car into a rolling
    office. No circumstance—illness, vacation, or family event—could interrupt
    his relentless output. His staff often found themselves scrambling to keep
    up with the constant stream of directives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’s management style was famously harsh and demanding. He expected his
    team to deliver quick, to-the-point answers, and had little tolerance for
    details that didn’t interest him. His impatience was legendary, sometimes
    boiling over into shouting, insults, or even throwing things. Despite
    growing older, Moses kept up a punishing schedule, swimming with vigor and
    writing prolifically. His stamina was both awe-inspiring and exhausting for
    those around him. This intensity set the tone for his entire organization,
    creating an atmosphere charged with urgency and a sense of reverence. Staff
    would rush to prepare for his arrival, treating him almost like royalty,
    always feeling the pressure to meet his high expectations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ironically, Moses’s personal finances didn’t match the grandeur of his
    public image. Even though he received generous commissions and bequests, he
    often found himself short on cash, spending freely and channeling his
    resources into his projects rather than personal wealth. Still, he lived
    with a certain imperial flair, enjoying luxury cars, personal drivers, and
    special privileges like breezing through toll booths. His offices and events
    were staffed by loyal entourages, and he hosted lavish lunches that both
    celebrated his accomplishments and reinforced his authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’s flair for spectacle and exclusivity was especially clear at places
    like Jones Beach and the Marine Stadium, which he developed as grand,
    state-funded venues for elite gatherings. The stadium featured extravagant
    productions on a stage surrounded by a moat, with the best seats reserved
    for corporations and Moses’s personal guests, including politicians and
    dignitaries. He personally chose the programming, often ignoring public
    preferences. Despite the scale and cost, public attendance was low, but
    Moses seemed more interested in prestige and exclusivity than popular
    appeal, repeating productions for his select audience.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jones Beach theater, unlike more centrally located venues, mainly
    catered to beachgoers and, more specifically, to Moses’s handpicked guests.
    The shows, led by Guy Lombardo and his orchestra, were essentially private
    events, heavily subsidized by public funds but run for the Lombardo
    brothers’ profit. Moses guaranteed their financial success by covering
    operational costs and granting them exclusive rights to theater revenues and
    advertising. Although lawmakers expected the theater to repay its $4.2
    million subsidy, taxpayers never saw a return, and by 1967, costs had
    ballooned by another $5 million. Public resources were used to create a
    regal experience for a privileged few, rather than serving the wider
    community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’s hospitality was legendary, marked by meticulous planning and a clear
    desire to impress and influence powerful people. Guests at Jones Beach and
    the Marine Theater were chauffeured in limousines, greeted by uniformed
    guides, and treated to private beaches, exclusive dining, and personalized
    service. The entertainment included special activities for children, prime
    theater seats, backstage tours, and post-show dancing. Moses himself, though
    often preoccupied with work, would make memorable appearances, charming
    guests with stories and personal warmth. Annual gatherings, such as those
    for his Yale classmates, were thoughtfully organized, creating a sense of
    camaraderie and leaving a lasting impression.
  </p>

  <p>
    But this hospitality was more than just social nicety—it was a calculated
    tool of influence. Once an outsider at Yale, Moses became the center of his
    social world by hosting extravagant events for a wide range of influential
    guests and their families. These gatherings ranged from elaborate tours and
    dinners for planners and officials to grand celebrations marking the
    completion of major public works, like bridges and dams. Major openings,
    such as the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge or the Robert Moses Power Dam, drew
    thousands of guests and dignitaries, with festivities sometimes stretching
    over several days. Through these events, Moses solidified his dominance and
    built loyalty among key figures in government, business, and the media.
  </p>

  <p>
    He also used hospitality as a political weapon, leveraging lavish parties
    and exclusive invitations to sway journalists and officials. Those who
    offered favorable coverage were rewarded with access, while dissenters found
    themselves shut out. His “working” lunches were carefully staged to
    discourage disagreement, with Moses surrounded by supportive aides and using
    a mix of charm, intimidation, and subtle pressure to win compliance. Many
    important decisions were made in these informal settings, allowing Moses to
    bypass official channels and further consolidate his power.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, the chapter presents Moses as a force of nature who reshaped New
    York City and its surroundings on a grand scale. As his power grew, so did
    his arrogance and sense of being above the law. Surrounded by yes-men and
    insulated from criticism, Moses became increasingly out of touch with the
    people he was supposed to serve. His refusal to use a hearing aid, his lack
    of firsthand experience with driving, and his outdated ideas about public
    recreation all contributed to a growing disconnect from the city’s changing
    needs. Despite his vision and achievements, Moses’s unchecked authority
    allowed him to impose outdated plans on millions, shaping the region
    according to his own, increasingly obsolete, vision.
