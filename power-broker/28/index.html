  <p>
    This chapter explores how public authorities in the United States evolved,
    with a particular focus on Robert Moses and his profound impact on New York
    City’s urban landscape. It opens by outlining the origins of public
    authorities—hybrid organizations that blend government powers with corporate
    structures to build and manage public projects funded by user fees. While
    these entities had a long history in England, they were rare in America
    until the early twentieth century. The creation of the Port of New York
    Authority in 1921 marked a turning point, introducing the first major
    American example. At first, public authorities were intended for single,
    self-contained projects, expected to dissolve once their debts were paid and
    tolls removed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Robert Moses initially followed this model. However, when projects like the
    Henry Hudson and Triborough bridges began generating unexpected surpluses,
    he saw an opportunity to redefine the purpose of public authorities. Instead
    of simply retiring debt, Moses realized these revenues could be used to
    finance new projects, creating a self-sustaining engine for urban
    development.
  </p>

  <p>
    This insight transformed the role of public authorities. By 1938, the steady
    income from Moses’ projects was so reliable that banks were eager to lend
    more, often at lower rates, confident in the security of toll revenues. This
    financial strength allowed Moses to dream bigger, envisioning an expansive
    network of highways, parks, and bridges. Yet, he faced significant hurdles:
    traditional public funding was drying up, and bureaucratic red tape limited
    his flexibility. Moses understood that to achieve his ambitions, he needed
    ongoing, discretionary control over authority revenues—freeing him from the
    constraints of city budgets and regulations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Civil service rules posed another major obstacle. Strict hiring practices,
    salary caps, and rigid assignments made it difficult for Moses to assemble
    and retain a skilled team. Tight controls on spending slowed down
    construction and hampered his ability to promote projects effectively. Moses
    saw that if he could control the flow of authority funds, he could sidestep
    these restrictions, reward loyal staff, and plan projects independently.
    This autonomy would let him present city leaders with fully developed plans,
    leaving them with little choice but to accept his proposals, since the city
    lacked the resources and expertise to offer alternatives. Securing legal
    control over authority revenues, then, was not just about money—it was about
    consolidating power.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ real genius lay in his legislative maneuvering. He embedded sweeping
    powers into the bond contracts of authorities like the Triborough Bridge
    Authority, making them nearly impossible to revoke. On the surface, his
    legislation appeared to include safeguards—such as limits on borrowing and
    authority lifespan—but hidden clauses allowed for endless refinancing and
    expansion into new projects. These legal tricks ensured that the authorities
    could operate indefinitely, well beyond their original mandates, and with
    little oversight from lawmakers who often failed to grasp the full
    implications. In effect, Moses created a quasi-independent “fourth branch”
    of government, shifting the balance of power in the city.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through careful legal drafting, Moses expanded the authority’s reach,
    granting it the ability to acquire land, build roads and parks, and exercise
    powers usually reserved for governments, such as eminent domain and law
    enforcement. He centralized control in his own hands, designing board
    structures and legal barriers that made it nearly impossible for anyone to
    challenge his leadership. The legal framework of these authorities shielded
    Moses from interference by state or city officials, freeing him from many
    democratic checks like public hearings and transparency requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    By harnessing the unique structure of public authorities, Moses was able to
    bypass traditional bureaucracy and deliver large-scale public works with
    remarkable efficiency. His independence, however, led to clashes with Mayor
    La Guardia, who eventually realized that Moses’ legal arrangements made him
    almost untouchable. The public’s admiration for Moses’ accomplishments,
    combined with his political connections and proven ability to get things
    done, made it politically risky to oppose him. In the end, Moses—despite
    never holding elected office—wielded as much influence over New York City’s
    transportation and recreation decisions as the mayor himself, securing his
    place as a powerful and nearly unassailable figure in the city’s history.
