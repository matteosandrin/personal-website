  <p>
    This chapter traces the rise of Robert Moses as a powerful force in New York
    during the late 1920s and early 1930s, spotlighting his ambitious parkway
    and park projects, the political battles that surrounded them, and the
    tangled relationships among the state’s top leaders. At its heart, the
    chapter examines how Moses’ sweeping vision for public works ran headlong
    into the realities of politics, entrenched privilege, and social inequality,
    leaving a permanent mark on both the landscape and the way New York was
    governed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story begins with Moses’ efforts to finish the Northern State Parkway
    after losing the unwavering support of Governor Al Smith, who was replaced
    by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Moses quickly found himself up against the wealthy
    landowners of Long Island’s North Shore, known as the “barons.” Determined
    to protect their sprawling estates in the Wheatley Hills, these influential
    figures hired lawyer Grenville Clark to fight the parkway’s proposed route.
    Although Roosevelt initially backed Moses, mounting political pressure and
    the threat of scandal—thanks to earlier deals Moses had struck with donors
    like Otto Kahn—forced a costly compromise. The parkway was rerouted to avoid
    the barons’ properties, and while the landowners paid only a fraction of the
    extra cost, taxpayers picked up the rest. This detour created a lasting
    inconvenience for commuters and denied the public access to some of Long
    Island’s most beautiful areas, fundamentally changing Moses’ original plan
    and underscoring the enduring power of the region’s elite.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter goes on to show how these compromises shaped the very design and
    function of the Northern State Parkway. Instead of providing direct access
    to parks as intended, the parkway forced drivers to take long detours, a
    clear sign of the barons’ influence. The winding curves around Wheatley and
    Dix Hills stand as physical reminders of the concessions Moses made. The
    impact wasn’t just on the map; people like farmer James Roth suffered
    personal losses as a result. While the names of the landowners have faded
    over time, their influence is still visible in the parkway’s twists and
    turns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ relationships with Governors Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt are
    another key thread. Moses was fiercely loyal to Smith but often found
    himself at odds with Roosevelt, whom he distrusted for his political
    maneuvering. Despite their personal differences and Moses’ refusal to grant
    Roosevelt’s patronage requests, Roosevelt recognized how essential Moses
    was, signing most of his bills and even expanding his authority. Moses’
    independence showed in his resistance to political job requests and his
    public campaign to turn Fort Schuyler into a park, directly opposing
    Roosevelt’s preference for a Merchant Marine Academy. In the end, Moses’
    political savvy and alliances often allowed him to get his way, even when it
    meant defying the governor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ mastery of government administration made him indispensable to
    Roosevelt, especially during legislative challenges to the executive budget
    system. His legal skills led to a decisive court victory that reinforced the
    separation of powers, while his tangible achievements—like the opening of
    Heckscher State Park, the Southern State Parkway, and Jones Beach—proved he
    could deliver on a grand scale. These projects were celebrated for their
    thoughtful design and attention to detail, earning Moses widespread praise
    and deepening Roosevelt’s reliance on his expertise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jones Beach, in particular, became a national model for public recreation.
    Its innovative architecture, cleanliness, and family-friendly atmosphere
    drew praise from all quarters. Moses enforced order with “Courtesy Squads”
    and strict anti-littering rules, and by banning commercial amusements, he
    created a unique environment. The beach’s popularity quickly outstripped its
    facilities, prompting Moses to propose further expansions and new parkways.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ ambitions didn’t stop there. He pushed for a massive expansion of the
    Ocean Parkway across Long Island, using political maneuvering and public
    support to secure land and funding. He overcame resistance from property
    owners and lawmakers, and the resulting parkway and related developments
    transformed Long Island, boosting property values and drawing millions of
    visitors—numbers that nearly matched the attendance of all national parks
    combined.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also explores the shifting dynamic between Moses and Roosevelt,
    showing how public works became central to political success. At first,
    Moses kept Roosevelt out of the spotlight at project ceremonies, but he
    eventually let the governor share in the credit, recognizing the political
    value of visible achievements. Moses’ willingness to take criticism
    protected elected officials, enhancing their reputations while increasing
    his own influence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet Moses’ dominance was not without controversy. His autocratic style led
    to clashes with conservationists like George Torrey, whose resignation only
    consolidated Moses’ control. More troubling were Moses’ discriminatory
    policies, which limited park access for poor and Black families through
    transportation barriers and targeted fees. These actions sparked public
    outrage but did little to diminish his authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter closes with the political fallout from Al Smith’s failed
    presidential run, engineered by rivals like William Randolph Hearst and
    ending in Smith’s quiet resignation. Moses’ lingering resentment is captured
    in a Shakespearean quote, highlighting the treacherous nature of politics
    and the personal cost of public ambition. Through these interconnected
    stories, the chapter reveals how Moses’ vision, political skill, and
    readiness to compromise—or exclude—shaped New York’s physical and social
    landscape for generations to come.
