  <p>
    The chapter explores Robert Moses’s early years at Yale, highlighting the
    challenges he faced as a Jewish student in a university dominated by
    Episcopalian traditions. Although Yale prided itself on being a “democracy
    of talent,” its social scene was anything but open. Jewish students like
    Moses were routinely excluded from the most prestigious societies, making it
    difficult to break into the school’s inner circles. Isolated by both his age
    and background, Moses often found himself alone, turning to books and poetry
    for companionship.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet, Moses’s sharp intellect and passion for literature gradually set him
    apart. His work with the Yale Courant and his participation on the swimming
    team helped him earn the respect of his peers. Unlike many classmates who
    were more interested in social climbing, Moses was driven by a genuine love
    of learning and a deep sense of idealism. He threw himself into art and
    literature, famously fixating on the Mona Lisa and studying works of Samuel
    Johnson.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses didn’t just accept Yale’s rigid social order; he actively pushed back
    against it. He championed the idea that recognition should be based on
    merit, not background, and worked to elevate minor sports by founding the
    Minor Sports Association. His efforts often put him at odds with the
    football establishment, but he didn’t shy away from confrontation. Through
    these actions, Moses showed an early willingness to stand up for his
    beliefs.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the years went by, Moses’s interests shifted further toward intellectual
    and literary pursuits. He led groups like the Kit Cat Club and co-edited a
    student poetry anthology, building a circle of friends who shared his
    interests and values. Academically, he excelled, earning top honors and
    forging connections with other thoughtful students. Even though he remained
    on the outside of Yale’s most exclusive organizations, Moses carved out his
    own space, demonstrating resilience and a knack for building influence in
    unconventional ways. These experiences would prove foundational,
    foreshadowing the strategies he would use throughout his career.
