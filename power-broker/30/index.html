  <p>
    This chapter vividly recounts the fierce clash between Robert Moses and a
    determined group of reformers over the future of Battery Park’s historic
    fort and beloved Aquarium. After losing a political battle to Franklin and
    Eleanor Roosevelt, Moses set his sights on the Aquarium and the old fort,
    claiming they were outdated and structurally unsound. However, engineers and
    members of the public repeatedly challenged these claims, emphasizing the
    sites’ historical and emotional importance. Despite mounting opposition,
    Moses pushed relentlessly for their demolition, making it clear to many that
    his campaign was driven more by personal vendetta than by genuine public
    need.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using his vast administrative power, Moses shut down Battery Park and the
    Aquarium, citing public safety concerns related to tunnel construction. He
    further tightened his grip by tying the Aquarium’s fate to crucial funding,
    leaving officials with little choice but to fall in line. Political leaders,
    wary of Moses’ influence and mindful of upcoming elections, gradually
    abandoned their resistance. Even Mayor La Guardia, despite his private
    doubts, eventually sided with Moses. Legal efforts by reformers to halt the
    destruction went nowhere, as the courts consistently upheld Moses’ sweeping
    authority over city parks. Although World War II shortages temporarily
    delayed the demolition, Moses kept the park closed for more than five years,
    a move that underscored both his power and the seeming hopelessness of
    opposing him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet the fight to preserve Castle Clinton was far from over. Led by George
    McAneny and a group of dedicated allies, reformers continued to challenge
    Moses’ misleading statements and lobbied federal officials for support.
    Their persistence finally paid off in 1950, when Congress designated the
    fort a national monument, marking a rare win for historic preservation.
    Still, the victory was bittersweet. While Castle Clinton was saved, the
    Aquarium was lost and replaced by a more expensive, less accessible facility
    at Coney Island, a change that highlighted Moses’ tendency to favor projects
    that separated the city by class. In the end, the episode left reformers
    disillusioned and wary, their view of Moses forever altered. It marked a
    turning point, not only in their perception of his legacy but also in the
    city’s sense of its own autonomy.
