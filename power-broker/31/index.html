  <p>
    In this chapter, the author details Robert Moses’ determined quest to take
    control of New York City’s tunnel crossings during World War II,
    highlighting his shrewd manipulation of politics, public opinion, and
    influential figures. Moses saw an opportunity in the wartime climate,
    convincing the federal government to stop tunnel construction by falsely
    claiming the materials were vital for the war effort. This move left the New
    York City Tunnel Authority in a vulnerable financial state—a situation Moses
    exaggerated to Mayor La Guardia, portraying the Authority as poorly managed
    and in need of rescue by his own Triborough Authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    A key part of Moses’ plan involved undermining Ole Singstad, the Tunnel
    Authority’s chief engineer. Moses dredged up unfounded conflict-of-interest
    accusations against Singstad, even though several investigations had already
    cleared him. By spreading these rumors, Moses sowed seeds of doubt in the
    mayor’s mind. When a board seat at the Tunnel Authority became vacant, Moses
    took advantage of the commissioners’ indecision, quietly placing his own
    supporters in key positions and orchestrating a seamless takeover. With
    this, Moses secured a monopoly over the city’s bridges and tunnels, amassing
    extraordinary political and financial influence reminiscent of the old
    robber barons.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once in power, Moses sidelined Singstad, using his engineering designs but
    denying him credit and excluding him from future projects. This effectively
    ended Singstad’s professional career in New York, leaving him isolated and
    resentful, despite his international reputation. Ironically, the tunnels
    Moses had once criticized soon turned into lucrative assets, generating
    profits that helped fund other city initiatives. Still, Moses continued to
    downplay their success, insisting they needed financial support from bridge
    revenues, which reinforced his own authority and narrative. Ultimately, the
    chapter exposes the sweeping impact of Moses’ ambition, shaping not only the
    city’s infrastructure but also the lives and careers of those around him.
