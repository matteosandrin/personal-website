  <p>
    This chapter paints a vivid picture of the tangled relationship between New
    York City’s postwar mayors and Robert Moses. Tracing the administrations of
    William O’Dwyer, Vincent Impellitteri, and Robert F. Wagner, Jr., the
    narrative explores how Moses steadily built, consolidated, and maintained
    his grip on the city, frequently sidelining democratic processes and the
    authority of elected officials in the process.
  </p>

  <h3 class="pt-4 text-2xl">O’Dwyer</h3>
  <p>
    The story begins with William O’Dwyer, an Irish immigrant whose charm and
    ambition carried him from modest beginnings to the mayor’s office. Despite
    his genuine love for New York and his desire to address its postwar
    challenges, O’Dwyer’s time as mayor was marred by persistent rumors of
    corruption and ties to organized crime figures like James F. Moran and Frank
    Costello. Overwhelmed by the city’s mounting deficits, neglected
    infrastructure, and urgent housing needs, O’Dwyer turned to Robert Moses,
    whose reputation for getting things done made him seem indispensable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses quickly seized the moment, proposing a sweeping fiscal plan that
    prioritized his own highway projects while pushing aside much-needed
    investments in schools and hospitals. He advocated for tax hikes and a
    subway fare increase that hit the city’s poor hardest, sparing the wealthy
    and favoring motorists. These moves drew sharp criticism from liberals such
    as Stanley Isaacs, who argued that Moses’ agenda forced low-income families
    to shoulder the burden for projects that mostly benefited the affluent.
    Moses also sought greater control over housing authority appointments and
    airport financing, raising further concerns about fairness and the
    concentration of power.
  </p>

  <p>
    The political wrangling around Moses’ airport plan showcased his knack for
    manipulating city and state politics. Despite objections from city officials
    like La Guardia and Comptroller Joseph, Moses used political pressure and
    threats to bring Democratic legislators in line with his vision. He
    sidelined city leaders and positioned himself as the key intermediary
    between city and state, ultimately securing expanded authority, new funding
    streams, and control over major projects. Throughout these negotiations,
    Moses kept crucial details hidden from both the mayor and the public,
    quietly amassing even more power.
  </p>

  <p>
    Grateful for Moses’ help during the fiscal crisis, O’Dwyer allowed him to
    fill agencies with loyalists and appoint key officials, giving Moses
    unprecedented sway over city policy. Moses openly bragged about his
    influence, reinforcing his image as the real power behind the
    administration. Yet as time went on, O’Dwyer grew frustrated with Moses’
    broken promises, especially regarding emergency housing for veterans and the
    disruptive effects of expressway construction. In response, O’Dwyer
    assembled a loyal team, backed planning reforms, and removed some of Moses’
    allies from influential posts. The breaking point came with the failed
    Idlewild airport financing plan, after which O’Dwyer stripped Moses of
    control over the city’s airports. Liberal groups called for Moses’ ouster,
    his access to the mayor was restricted, and his resignation was refused,
    marking a rare—if short-lived—dip in his power.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even after these setbacks, Moses remained a force to be reckoned with.
    O’Dwyer’s attempts to launch housing projects stalled until Moses stepped in
    and secured full state funding, reasserting his influence. In
    transportation, Moses controlled key funding and could speed up or slow down
    projects to suit his own agenda, often undermining the mayor’s credibility.
    By pushing rival expressway projects and withdrawing support for parking
    garages, Moses ensured that any major accomplishments would be credited to
    him or his allies, not O’Dwyer.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the chapter’s most dramatic moments centers on the city’s bid to host
    the United Nations headquarters. Moses used his access to city funds and his
    connections with wealthy insiders to quickly marshal resources for the
    project. When the original Flushing Meadows site fell out of favor and the
    city lacked funds for a Manhattan location, Moses orchestrated a complex
    deal involving developer William Zeckendorf and the Rockefeller family.
    Through secret negotiations, he secured an $8.5 million gift from John D.
    Rockefeller, Jr., and navigated legal and legislative hurdles with
    remarkable speed. His decisive actions won him gratitude from key players
    and restored his access to the mayor, further cementing his dominance.
  </p>

  <p>
    As O’Dwyer’s reliance on Moses deepened, Moses became the go-to figure for
    decisions on contracts, urban planning, and construction. His appointment as
    chair of the Mayor’s Committee on Slum Clearance gave him sweeping authority
    over urban renewal under the Housing Act of 1949. Despite some public
    criticism, Moses’ reputation for efficiency and integrity kept him at the
    center of city affairs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The political dynamics of O’Dwyer’s 1949 re-election campaign further
    highlighted Moses’ influence. While O’Dwyer was already popular, Moses’
    support through public works and ceremonial events gave the campaign an
    extra boost. After the election, Moses resumed controversial tenant
    relocations for his highway projects. The appointment of Jerry Finkelstein
    as chairman of the City Planning Commission brought a new push for reform,
    as Finkelstein advocated for a comprehensive Master Plan and exposed the
    inefficiencies of fragmented city departments. Despite Moses’ efforts to
    sway him, Finkelstein remained committed to reform.
  </p>

  <p>
    The clash between Moses and Finkelstein over city planning was fierce.
    Moses, feeling threatened by proposed increases in planning staff, tried to
    block changes both privately and publicly, calling Finkelstein’s approach
    wasteful. However, Finkelstein rallied support from reformers and secured
    funding for his initiatives. The struggle came to a head over the
    Mid-Manhattan Elevated Expressway, where Moses’ financial clout ultimately
    determined the project’s fate, despite opposition favoring a less disruptive
    tunnel alternative.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also discusses the broader context of the era, marked by
    corruption scandals and O’Dwyer’s eventual downfall. Persistent rumors of
    his retirement, investigations into racketeering and police corruption, and
    the pressure of televised Senate hearings eventually forced O’Dwyer to
    resign and accept an ambassadorship to Mexico, leaving office under a cloud
    reminiscent of earlier Tammany Hall scandals.
  </p>

  <h3 class="pt-4 text-2xl">Impellitteri</h3>
  <p>
    Vincent R. Impellitteri’s accidental rise to the mayoralty after O’Dwyer’s
    resignation is depicted almost as a comedy of errors. An obscure legal
    secretary chosen for political balance, Impellitteri became a figurehead
    manipulated by others. His campaign, managed by savvy PR professionals, cast
    him as an independent, anti-corruption candidate closely linked to Moses,
    whose endorsement proved pivotal. Once in office, Impellitteri was
    overwhelmed, lacked initiative, and deferred to others, ultimately proving
    ill-suited for the job.
  </p>

  <p>
    During Impellitteri’s brief tenure, Moses’ influence reached its peak. He
    effectively ran city decisions, holding daily private meetings at Gracie
    Mansion where he presented documents for the mayor to sign. His
    recommendations shaped high-level appointments and major policies. Moses
    also blocked independent planning efforts, notably preventing the
    publication and adoption of the City Planning Commission’s Master Plan by
    manipulating appointments and votes to ensure only his loyalists held power.
  </p>

  <p>
    With Moses back in control, the reforms started by Finkelstein were quickly
    undone. Efforts to prioritize neighborhood needs and rational city planning
    were abandoned, young planners were pushed out, and investments in planning
    went to waste. Moses’ dominance extended to the City Council and Board of
    Estimate, where he stifled opposition and pushed through his projects,
    focusing on highways at the expense of schools, colleges, and libraries.
    This led to lopsided spending, overcrowded schools, and inadequate public
    facilities, while the city’s debt and maintenance costs soared. Moses’
    approach favored rapid construction over long-term sustainability, leaving
    the city struggling to maintain its infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also highlights how city spending priorities shifted during the
    O’Dwyer and Impellitteri years, with funds diverted from essential services
    to public works, even as the city’s most vulnerable residents needed more
    support. School maintenance was severely underfunded, creating a massive
    backlog of repairs. Meanwhile, Moses controlled the flow of state and
    federal funds, fueling vast construction projects and further entrenching
    his power. Though largely invisible to the public and press, Moses’
    influence was decisive in shaping the city’s development and bureaucracy.
    Impellitteri’s political downfall was blamed on unpopular policies driven by
    Moses, who remained unaccountable and only grew more powerful.
  </p>

  <h3 class="pt-4 text-2xl">Wagner</h3>
  <p>
    The chapter closes with the transition to Robert F. Wagner, Jr.’s
    administration, which reformers hoped would finally rein in Moses. Despite
    initial resistance, Wagner ultimately gave in to Moses’ demands, allowing
    him to keep all his influential roles after a private confrontation. Moses
    continued to dominate the Housing Authority and other agencies through
    strategic appointments and behind-the-scenes maneuvering, even after formal
    reorganizations reduced his direct authority. In areas like parks and
    transportation, his power remained virtually unchallenged, with Wagner
    repeatedly yielding to his demands.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, the chapter offers a compelling portrait of Robert Moses as the
    driving force behind New York City’s postwar transformation. Through a mix
    of political savvy, institutional control, and relentless ambition, Moses
    shaped the city’s development, often overriding the intentions of elected
    officials and the needs of its most vulnerable residents. The mayors of this
    era—O’Dwyer, Impellitteri, and Wagner—come across as largely powerless in
    the face of Moses’ dominance, their legacies defined as much by their
    inability to control him as by their own actions. The chapter ultimately
    sheds light on the ongoing tension between democratic governance and
    technocratic power in the making of modern cities.
