  <p>
    This chapter talks about the intense political showdown that unfolded in
    1930s New York, focusing on the power struggle between Robert Moses,
    President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and other influential figures of the era.
    At the heart of the conflict was the battle for control over the city’s
    major public works projects, a fight that also raised bigger questions about
    the balance between federal and local authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story opens with Roosevelt’s deep-seated dislike for Moses. Determined
    to curb Moses’ influence, the President tried to leverage federal funding as
    a way to push him out of his prominent roles in New York City. Roosevelt
    enlisted Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes to carry out this plan.
    Armed with a new Public Works Administration order, Ickes pressured Mayor
    Fiorello La Guardia to remove Moses from the Triborough Bridge Authority. La
    Guardia, however, found himself in a difficult position. He was torn between
    the demands coming from Washington and the risk of alienating New Yorkers,
    who might see any move against Moses as giving in to federal meddling.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses, never one to back down quietly, responded with characteristic
    shrewdness. He threatened to resign from all his posts and made it clear he
    would publicly reveal the political motivations behind the effort to oust
    him. This move put La Guardia in an even tougher spot, making it politically
    dangerous to go along with Roosevelt’s wishes. Moses then took the fight to
    the public by leaking news of the federal order to the press. He
    successfully cast himself as the underdog, unfairly targeted by an
    overreaching federal government, while painting Roosevelt as the aggressor.
    The media quickly picked up the story, and public opinion swung in Moses’
    favor. Newspapers, civic groups, and even some of Moses’ former critics
    rallied to his side, making it nearly impossible for La Guardia or Roosevelt
    to act without risking a major backlash.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the controversy grew, it became more than just a personal feud. The
    dispute came to symbolize the broader tension between local independence and
    centralized federal power. Legal experts and reformers like William D.
    Guthrie questioned whether Roosevelt’s order was even constitutional,
    calling it an abuse of executive authority. The debate spilled into
    Congress, with leaders such as Bertrand Snell and populists like Huey Long
    speaking out against the administration’s actions. The pressure mounted
    until former Governor Al Smith stepped in to defend Moses, prompting
    Roosevelt to look for a way out. In the end, Roosevelt relented, exempting
    Moses and others from the order. This retreat was widely seen as a win for
    Moses and a setback for Ickes and the federal government.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the aftermath, Moses emerged stronger than ever. The opening of the
    Triborough Bridge turned into a major public event, with Roosevelt in
    attendance despite the lingering tension. Moses handled the occasion with
    his usual confidence, further solidifying his position in New York politics.
    The chapter wraps up by reflecting on the nature of political patronage and
    self-reliance, drawing on the story of Samuel Johnson and Lord Chesterfield
    to highlight how Moses succeeded through his own determination and skill,
    rather than by depending on powerful allies. Ultimately, this episode serves
    as a vivid illustration of how ego, politics, and public perception can
    shape the course of urban history.
