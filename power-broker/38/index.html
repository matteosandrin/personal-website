  <p>
    This chapter discusses the deep and lasting effects the construction of the
    Cross-Bronx Expressway had on East Tremont, painting a vivid picture of the
    upheaval experienced by its residents. At first, tenants were hurriedly
    forced out of their homes, only for everyone to realize later that the rush
    was unnecessary. Construction stalled for years, held up by underestimated
    costs and a lack of funding. What began as a $47 million project eventually
    ballooned to $250 million, with progress grinding to a halt until federal
    money finally came through in 1956. In the meantime, those who stayed behind
    faced constant blasting, deafening noise, and clouds of dust that damaged
    buildings and made everyday life almost impossible.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the disruption went far beyond physical discomfort. Local shops were
    either torn down or fenced off, making simple errands a challenge. As the
    construction dragged on, uncertainty and frustration pushed many residents
    to move away. Landlords, eager to profit from the turnover, began renting to
    poorer, less stable tenants—mostly Black families migrating from the South.
    This shift in the neighborhood’s makeup heightened tensions with the
    long-established Jewish community. As vandalism and crime increased, even
    more families and businesses packed up and left, accelerating the area’s
    decline. A particularly shocking crime in Crotona Park seemed to mark a
    point of no return, triggering a mass exodus.
  </p>

  <p>
    Community leaders tried to breathe new life into East Tremont through
    housing programs, but their efforts were repeatedly blocked by Robert Moses’
    ever-expanding redevelopment plans. These plans displaced even more people
    and drove rents out of reach for most. Red tape and Moses’ tight grip on key
    properties made it nearly impossible to secure land for affordable housing.
    In the end, the neighborhood’s sense of community unraveled. Frustration and
    helplessness drove even the most steadfast residents to leave. Once-sturdy
    apartment buildings became dilapidated and dangerous, and East Tremont was
    left a hollow version of the vibrant neighborhood it had once been.
