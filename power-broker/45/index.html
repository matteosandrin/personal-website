  <p>
    This chapter traces the dramatic collapse of Robert Moses’ carefully
    cultivated public image and the exposure of corruption within his urban
    renewal program, Title I, during the late 1950s. The story opens in 1959, a
    turning point when mounting pressure from New York’s Citizens Union and a
    newly emboldened press forced Moses to open the files of his Slum Clearance
    Committee to public inspection. Moses, long used to unquestioned authority,
    bristled at inquiries about how Title I project sponsors were chosen. He
    named several prominent individuals, but notably left out Tammany Hall
    politician Samuel Caspert, who played a crucial role behind the scenes.
    Reporters, no longer satisfied with vague answers, seized on these omissions
    and Moses’ admission that sponsors were selected without competitive
    bidding. When asked if there were written reports on sponsor qualifications,
    Moses—perhaps underestimating the press or unaware of what the files
    actually contained—agreed to release them. Yet when journalists examined the
    files, they found them stripped of any meaningful information, a move that
    only deepened suspicions of deliberate cover-up.
  </p>

  <p>
    The narrative then follows the dogged efforts of investigative reporters
    like Haddad and Kahn. Working with scant resources and even a temperamental
    car, they managed to uncover a scandal that would forever change how the
    public viewed Moses’ urban renewal efforts. Their big break came when they
    found evidence linking Louis I. Pokrass, an associate of notorious mobster
    Frank Costello, to a Title I project. This connection, which Moses’ own
    staff had missed, shifted the story from bureaucratic bungling to outright
    scandal. As the investigation continued, more links to organized crime
    surfaced, some stronger than others. Moses dismissed these revelations as
    unfair and irrelevant, but the damage was done. The scandal sparked a wave
    of investigative reporting, with journalists digging deeper and uncovering
    even more troubling details.
  </p>

  <p>
    As reporters pressed on, they revealed a tangled web of corruption and
    political influence running through the Title I program. By carefully
    sifting through documents, Haddad and his colleagues identified press agents
    like Sydney S. Baron and William J. Donoghue as go-betweens for powerful
    political figures, including Carmine De Sapio and other Tammany Hall
    insiders, who profited handsomely from the program. Another reporter,
    Gleason, exposed a shady land deal at Clason Point, showing how political
    insiders cashed in on urban renewal. The investigation also highlighted the
    role of Shanahan, Moses’ vice chairman, who used his bank’s influence to
    steer sponsor selection and benefit from risk-free, government-backed loans.
    Reporters shared leads and findings, keeping the momentum alive and
    gradually exposing just how deeply Moses’ projects were entwined with New
    York’s political machine.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first, only a handful of determined reporters and editors—especially
    those at the Post and World-Telegram—pursued the story, often facing
    criticism and pushback. Their persistence paid off as the story gained
    traction, eventually drawing in larger outlets like the New York Times,
    which lent greater credibility and depth to the coverage. As the media
    spotlight intensified, politicians began to weigh in, and newsroom attitudes
    shifted from skepticism to support. The investigations increasingly
    implicated Moses and his associates, revealing questionable relationships
    and practices. The chapter also touches on the personal and ethical
    challenges faced by reporters as they confronted the human consequences of
    their reporting.
  </p>

  <p>
    With each new revelation, Moses, once seemingly untouchable, became the
    central figure in a series of exposés linking his closest associates to
    corruption and dubious financial dealings. As journalists uncovered hefty
    consultant fees and conflicts of interest involving Moses’ aides, his own
    name moved from the margins to the headlines. Moses’ response—lashing out at
    the press and trying to limit reporters’ access—only fueled further scrutiny
    and shifted even more attention onto him. Newspapers that had once supported
    him grew more critical, and even the New York Times, initially defensive,
    cooled in its support as Moses continued to attack their reporting. This
    cycle showed how Moses’ combative tactics ultimately backfired, undermining
    his reputation and intensifying the very scandals he hoped to quash.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the end of 1959, Moses’ public image was in tatters, but his real power
    remained largely untouched. His authority was rooted not in popularity, but
    in his control over public authorities and vast financial resources. Mayor
    Wagner, reliant on Moses for both political and economic reasons, couldn’t
    afford to fire or alienate him. The press, unaware of the true depth of
    Moses’ institutional power, often misread the situation, focusing on
    surface-level scandals rather than the entrenched systems that kept Moses in
    control.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Moses considered taking on the presidency of the World’s Fair, he faced a
    mix of personal and professional challenges: his daughter’s illness, family
    financial strains, and his wife’s declining health. Professionally, the
    World’s Fair represented a fresh opportunity—a way to restore his
    reputation, gain new prestige, and perhaps achieve national recognition.
    Moses’ transition to the Fair was carefully managed, with political
    maneuvering delaying his exit from city roles. Despite the scandals and
    opposition, he left his positions on a high note, celebrated by New York’s
    elite, and ensured his continued influence by installing loyal successors.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, the chapter makes it clear that while Moses may have stepped
    down from some city posts, he retained significant control over major public
    works. His authority, anchored in a network of public agencies, remained
    almost impossible to challenge. The exposés and scandals may have tarnished
    his image, but they barely touched the real foundations of his power. Only
    Moses himself, through his own actions, could truly threaten his position.
