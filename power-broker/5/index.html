  <p>
    This chapter follows Robert Moses as he launches an ambitious campaign to
    overhaul New York City’s civil service system, setting him on a collision
    course with the powerful Tammany Hall political machine. At the time,
    Tammany’s grip on city politics depended on a patronage network that handed
    out jobs in exchange for loyalty, so any effort to reform the system
    threatened their very foundation. Reformers like Henry Moskowitz and Darwin
    R. James, despite their determination, quickly found themselves stymied by
    bureaucratic inertia and fierce political opposition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses, known for both his expertise and relentless drive, proposed a
    sweeping transformation of the city’s efficiency-rating system. He
    envisioned a strict meritocracy, where favoritism would be replaced by
    objective standards. Leading a dedicated team, Moses helped design an
    intricate grading system that broke down every government job into specific
    tasks, assigning numerical values to employees' qualities. Promotions and
    salaries would be based solely on exam scores and mathematical evaluations,
    with no consideration for seniority or educational background. Moses was
    adamant that only ability should matter, and he advocated for demoting or
    firing anyone who failed to meet the new, rigorous benchmarks. His
    uncompromising idealism won him praise from fellow reformers and some city
    officials.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Moses’ plan also sparked fierce resistance. Thousands of city workers,
    especially those in higher positions, saw their livelihoods and status
    threatened. Moses’ inflexible, sometimes high-handed approach only fueled
    their opposition, and Tammany Hall seized the opportunity to fight back.
    They leaked Moses’ more elitist writings to the press and packed public
    hearings with critics, turning the debate into a personal battle and eroding
    support for reform. Even some of Moses’ allies began to urge a slower, more
    cautious rollout, but he refused to back down.
  </p>

  <p>
    As World War I loomed, the city’s political winds shifted. Tammany Hall
    regained its footing, and the Board of Aldermen watered down Moses’ plan
    with a host of exceptions. Tammany loyalists in the civil service sabotaged
    enforcement, and the courts proved unsympathetic. Moses became increasingly
    frustrated with Mayor Mitchel, who seemed more interested in protecting the
    wealthy than supporting real reform. The final blow came in the 1917 mayoral
    election, when Tammany capitalized on widespread resentment among city
    workers to reclaim power. The new mayor, John Hylan, wasted no time
    dismantling Moses’ reforms and restoring the patronage system.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the aftermath, Moses found himself isolated and struggling. While his
    contemporaries moved on to influential roles, he faced rejection after
    rejection, scraping by in minor clerical jobs and dealing with financial
    strain. The national mood had soured, and the era of progressive reform
    seemed to be over. Yet, just as Moses’ prospects looked bleakest, an
    unexpected call from Belle Moskowitz offered a glimmer of hope. The chapter
    closes on this note, capturing both the lofty ambitions and the harsh
    realities faced by idealistic reformers in the shadow of entrenched
    political power.
