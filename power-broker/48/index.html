  <p>
    The chapter captures a pivotal moment in New York City’s political history,
    tracing the shift from Robert Moses’ long-standing dominance to the
    emergence of Mayor John V. Lindsay in the mid-1960s. For more than twenty
    years, Moses had been the city’s ultimate power broker, with politicians
    routinely seeking his approval. But Lindsay’s election in 1965 signaled a
    new direction. Unlike his predecessors, Lindsay and his allies didn’t shy
    away from criticizing Moses’ approach to parks, transportation, and housing.
    Their reform-minded energy promised sweeping changes, especially in how the
    city managed its public authorities. Lindsay, brimming with youthful
    confidence, set out to consolidate transportation agencies and redirect
    funding from highways to mass transit. He brought in outspoken critics of
    Moses and underestimated just how deeply Moses’ influence was woven into the
    city’s institutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet, Lindsay’s optimism quickly ran up against reality. Neither he nor his
    advisors fully grasped the extent of Moses’ legal acumen, institutional
    memory, or political connections. Moses was far from obsolete; he remained a
    sharp and resourceful opponent. When Lindsay’s administration tried to merge
    public authorities and shift funding priorities, Moses and his legal team
    pushed back, arguing that such changes would violate bondholder agreements
    and the constitution. While the press largely overlooked these legal
    arguments, Moses’ grip on highway planning and federal funding remained a
    powerful lever. Attempts to persuade him to step aside were futile. Moses
    made it clear he was motivated by power, not personal reward, and he had no
    intention of supporting reforms that would undermine his authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lindsay’s circle believed they could soon topple Moses’ influence, but they
    misjudged the political landscape in Albany. Despite reassurances from
    Governor Rockefeller, they failed to see how deeply Moses and his allies
    were entrenched among legislative leaders and influential interest groups.
    At a crucial hearing, Lindsay’s proposal was blindsided by a coalition of
    political, financial, and labor leaders. The administration’s lack of
    preparation was exposed as Moses and his supporters systematically
    dismantled the plan, turning the hearing into a public defeat for Lindsay.
  </p>

  <p>
    After this setback, Moses’ power began to ebb, especially as Governor
    Rockefeller started to distance himself. Lindsay’s moves to limit Moses’
    influence, such as appointing new board members, were mostly symbolic
    gestures. While Lindsay’s reform efforts attracted plenty of attention, the
    real decline of Moses’ authority came from shifting alliances at the state
    level. This marked the beginning of the end for Moses’ era of control over
    New York City politics.
