  <p>
    This chapter recounts a defining moment in the history of Central Park,
    zeroing in on the fierce dispute between local activists and the influential
    Park Commissioner, Robert Moses, over a proposed parking lot near
    Tavern-on-the-Green in 1956. The story opens with a group of mothers who,
    after stumbling upon blueprints for the parking lot that threatened a
    cherished glen where their children played, sprang into action to defend the
    space. This glen, originally envisioned by Frederick Law Olmsted as a
    peaceful haven, had already suffered from Moses’ earlier changes, including
    the removal of sheep and the addition of roads and playgrounds. When Roselle
    Davis discovered the plans, she quickly enlisted other mothers, among them
    Augusta Newman. Newman’s husband tapped into the neighborhood’s vibrant
    artistic community, helping to organize a petition and reach out to city
    officials. Although their initial appeals were largely ignored by the
    bureaucracy, media attention soon thrust the issue into the public eye,
    compelling city leaders to address the mothers’ concerns.
  </p>

  <p>
    What set this protest apart from earlier resistance to Moses’ projects was
    the makeup and determination of the opposition. In the past, Moses had
    managed to push through controversial changes by keeping his plans under
    wraps and brushing off local protests. He routinely disregarded pleas from
    community members, including mothers fighting to save trees in other parks,
    and focused on cultivating positive press rather than engaging with the
    public. This time, however, the protesters were affluent, well-connected,
    and knowledgeable about the law. The issue itself was straightforward, and
    Central Park’s unique place in the city’s identity made the conflict
    especially potent. These factors combined to create a challenge Moses
    couldn’t easily dismiss.
  </p>

  <p>
    Central Park’s iconic status only heightened the drama. The media treated
    threats to the park as front-page news, a level of attention rarely given to
    similar disputes elsewhere. The mothers’ campaign, led by figures like
    Elinor Sanger and Augusta Newman, quickly escalated into a citywide
    controversy as reporters and photographers from every major outlet descended
    on the scene. Their coverage transformed what might have been a routine,
    behind-the-scenes project into a highly visible showdown, putting Moses’
    tactics under a microscope and signaling a shift in his public standing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tensions reached a boiling point when Moses ordered the removal of trees
    during National Arbor Week, a move that struck many as particularly
    tone-deaf. The press dubbed the conflict “The Battle of Central Park,”
    casting the mothers as determined defenders against a powerful bureaucrat.
    The actual demolition took place at night, with police and park workers
    cordoning off the area to keep protesters at bay. Heart-wrenching images of
    mothers and children barred from their playground flooded newspapers and
    television broadcasts, sparking widespread outrage and prompting thousands
    of protest letters to city officials.
  </p>

  <p>
    The backlash was immediate and intense. Even some of Moses’ longtime
    supporters voiced anger and disappointment at his secretive approach and
    apparent willingness to put commercial interests ahead of public spaces for
    children. The sight of mothers in tears as bulldozers destroyed the
    playground became a symbol of the community’s sense of loss and betrayal.
    The controversy also brought to light questionable financial dealings
    between the city and the Tavern-on-the-Green concessionaire, further
    damaging Moses’ reputation for honesty.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, mounting legal threats, damaging revelations, and unrelenting
    media scrutiny forced Moses to back down. Instead of a parking lot, a new
    playground would be built. While this compromise allowed Moses to retain
    some dignity, the episode shattered his image as an untouchable public
    servant. Though minor in legal terms, the scandal marked a turning point,
    proving that Moses could be challenged and defeated, and forever changing
    how New Yorkers saw the man once hailed as the guardian of their parks.
