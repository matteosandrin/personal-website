  <p>
    This chapter traces Robert Moses’s intense ambition and transformative
    leadership during a crucial era for New York’s parks and parkways, with a
    spotlight on the creation of Jones Beach and the rapid growth of Long
    Island’s park system.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a heated dispute over bathhouses, Moses found himself not victorious,
    but anxious. He realized that Governor Al Smith’s looming departure could
    jeopardize both his political backing and the future of his grand plans.
    With time running out, Moses turned Belmont Mansion into a bustling
    headquarters, where he enforced strict deadlines and demanded detailed,
    fact-based updates from his staff. His relentless work schedule, often
    stretching from sunrise to midnight, set a grueling pace that his team felt
    compelled to match. Even during family outings, Moses’s dedication was on
    full display, inspiring those around him to keep up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite the pressure, Moses managed to foster a sense of unity and
    excitement among his staff. The demanding environment became a shared
    adventure, strengthened by a familial atmosphere. He often brought his own
    family into the workplace and organized informal gatherings that helped
    colleagues bond. Moses encouraged his team to think creatively, insisting on
    unique design touches like distinctive bridges and wooden guardrails
    reinforced with steel cable. He welcomed imaginative ideas, such as the
    playful signage at Jones Beach. Although he lacked formal training in law or
    engineering, Moses’s broad knowledge and sweeping vision motivated his team
    to push beyond their limits, tackling enormous physical and political
    obstacles with determination.
  </p>

  <p>
    The building of Jones Beach showcased the scale of these challenges. Moses
    and his team faced brutal winter weather, with surveyors working in
    isolation and surviving on little more than pancakes as they completed
    crucial surveys. They soon discovered that the barrier beach was dangerously
    low, which meant they had to undertake a massive hydraulic fill operation
    using the country’s largest dredges. To combat the problem of blowing sand,
    workers planted millions of clumps of beach grass by hand. When money ran
    short, Moses didn’t hesitate to borrow $20,000 from his mother to pay the
    workers, demonstrating his willingness to make personal sacrifices. Legal
    and political roadblocks, including disputes with wealthy landowners and
    resistance from Babylon Township, were met with Moses’s characteristic
    persistence and strategic maneuvering. In order to acquire the land from
    Babylon, Moses resorted to influencing their referendum. Moses used legal
    loopholes and manipulated voting procedures to secure the outcome he needed.
    Although this sparked outrage among locals, it allowed the state to press
    ahead with the rapid construction of the Southern State Parkway and
    causeway.
  </p>
  <p>
    By 1928, Moses had expanded Long Island’s park system from a single park to
    fourteen, built an extensive network of parkways, and preserved scenic sites
    upstate, making parks accessible to millions. His accomplishments, closely
    aligned with his original vision, reshaped the region’s landscape and
    recreational life, securing his reputation as a visionary builder and public
    servant.
