  <p>
    This chapter follows the remarkable journey of Joseph Papp’s free
    Shakespeare Festival as it took root in New York City’s parks, highlighting
    the complex mix of personalities, politics, and public sentiment that
    influenced its development. At the outset, Robert Moses, the powerful and
    often intimidating parks commissioner, surprisingly became one of Papp’s
    earliest supporters. Although Moses was known for his tough demeanor, he had
    a genuine appreciation for Shakespeare and was impressed by Papp’s
    dedication to bringing theater to everyone, especially those who couldn’t
    otherwise afford it. Thanks to Moses’s backing, Papp was able to stage his
    first productions in Central Park, turning the space into a lively cultural
    hub that attracted a wide range of audiences and won over critics.
  </p>

  <p>
    This early momentum, however, soon ran into trouble. Stuart Constable, a
    conservative figure within the parks department, began to challenge Papp’s
    vision for the festival. Motivated by both personal misgivings and political
    suspicion—including doubts about Papp’s political beliefs and his Jewish
    heritage—Constable imposed steep financial demands that put the festival’s
    future in jeopardy. When Papp sought help from Moses, hoping he would
    intervene, Moses instead stood by Constable, valuing loyalty within his
    ranks over the festival’s broader mission. With his project hanging in the
    balance, Papp responded by launching a clever public campaign. He used humor
    and sharp commentary to poke fun at the park’s objections, drawing the
    media’s attention and winning over public support.
  </p>

  <p>
    As tensions rose, Moses escalated the conflict by orchestrating anonymous
    attacks, accusing Papp of communist ties and financial misconduct. These
    smear tactics, reminiscent of the McCarthy era, failed to gain traction in
    the more progressive atmosphere of the late 1950s. Instead, the press and
    the public rallied around Papp, casting Moses as the villain and tarnishing
    his once-formidable reputation. The dispute eventually reached City Hall,
    drawing in Mayor Robert Wagner. Despite the mounting controversy, Wagner
    found himself unable to curb Moses’s actions due to political realities.
    Ultimately, the courts intervened, ruling that Moses’s efforts to block the
    festival were “arbitrary and capricious.” This decision forced Moses to
    allow the festival to continue, though with certain conditions attached.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the aftermath, Papp emerged stronger than before. The ordeal boosted his
    public profile and helped secure the resources needed to build the Delacorte
    Amphitheater. Meanwhile, Moses’s reputation suffered a significant blow, and
    the episode signaled a shift in the city’s power dynamics. From that point
    on, Moses faced increased scrutiny from both the public and the media,
    marking the beginning of a new era in New York’s civic life.
