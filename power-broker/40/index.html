  <p>
    The chapter takes a deep dive into the ways Robert Moses, wielding the power
    of the Triborough Authority and forging key alliances with the Port
    Authority, dramatically transformed New York City’s transportation landscape
    in the mid-1900s. It follows the rise of Moses’ influence, the financial and
    political tactics that cemented his dominance, and the far-reaching, often
    damaging effects of his car-focused vision on the city and its suburbs.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the early 1950s, Moses had built up enormous financial clout through the
    Triborough Authority, which was flush with toll revenue and annual
    surpluses. Yet this wealth came with strings attached. Both the public and
    politicians began demanding that Moses use these surpluses to pay off bonds
    or support the city’s struggling subway system—moves that would have limited
    his independence. To keep control, Moses realized he needed to spend the
    money quickly on new projects, ensuring the Authority’s resources stayed
    firmly in his hands. His ambitions were huge, with plans for projects like
    the Throgs Neck Bridge, the Narrows Crossing, and Jamaica Bay park that far
    outstripped even Triborough’s deep pockets. The launch of the Federal
    Interstate Highway System brought the promise of federal funding, but also
    new hurdles: interstate projects required working with the Port Authority of
    New York and New Jersey. Political realities, especially the relationship
    between Mayor Wagner and Port Authority leaders, made cooperation both
    attractive and necessary. By partnering with the Port Authority, Moses could
    tap into both federal and local funding, keeping his projects moving and his
    authority intact.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, the Port Authority itself had built up a large cash surplus from
    postwar traffic, but had lost the bold leadership of its early years and was
    now focused on profit-driven, disconnected ventures. Moses, still driven by
    sweeping urban planning dreams, saw a chance to use the Authority’s
    resources for his own ambitious bypass around New York. Despite some initial
    tension, both Moses and the Port Authority’s business-minded board saw the
    benefits of working together. Moses needed the Authority’s money and reach,
    while the Authority needed his political muscle and approval for key
    projects like bridge expansions and expressways. Both sides also faced
    outside pressure to improve mass transit and spend their surpluses before
    politicians could redirect the funds. Their shared interests in boosting
    toll revenues and integrating projects into the Interstate Highway System
    led to a formal partnership, marked by a joint study in 1955 that mapped out
    a comprehensive arterial network for the region.
  </p>

  <p>
    This “Joint Study” and the resulting “Joint Program” recommended immediate
    construction of major bridges such as the Throgs Neck and Verrazano, as well
    as double-decking the George Washington Bridge. These projects were part of
    a sweeping network of new expressways across the city and suburbs, including
    the Bergen County and Clearview expressways. At its core, the arrangement
    was a business deal: Moses leveraged his power, the Port Authority provided
    funding—especially for the Narrows Bridge, which Moses would control. The
    program generated huge profits for both authorities, with millions in annual
    tolls, and solidified Moses’s influence, backed by powerful automotive and
    construction interests. In the end, the Joint Program was more than just
    infrastructure expansion; it was a profit-driven coalition that shaped New
    York’s future according to Moses’s vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the Joint Program and control over funding, Moses enforced strict
    loyalty among city officials to his vision, which heavily favored highways
    and car facilities over mass transit. He used his authority to threaten to
    pull funds or support if any part of his program was questioned, effectively
    silencing real opposition. The combined financial power of the Triborough
    and Port Authorities in 1955—over $1.2 billion—could have modernized the
    Long Island Rail Road, built new commuter parking, created a trans-Hudson
    rail loop, and upgraded the subway system. Instead, almost all resources
    went into roads and bridges, with mass transit receiving little to no
    investment. Between 1955 and 1965, $2.7 billion was spent on highways, while
    not a single mile of new subway or railroad was built. New York’s mass
    transit system was left to limp along on infrastructure dating back to the
    early 20th century, a direct result of Moses’ priorities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fallout from these decisions soon became clear as New York’s mass
    transit system slid into decline. Commuters faced daily struggles: many
    suburbanites had to drive or take long bus rides just to reach overcrowded
    subway stations, where rush hour felt like a chaotic scramble for space.
    Promised improvements, like the Second Avenue Subway, were endlessly
    delayed, forcing more riders onto already packed lines. Despite available
    funds, technological upgrades and new subway cars were neglected, and a
    policy of deferred maintenance led to worsening safety and reliability. By
    the late 1960s, breakdowns, derailments, and even deadly accidents were
    common, and the system’s cleanliness and comfort had sharply deteriorated.
    Under Moses, New York’s once world-class transit system became one of the
    worst, plagued by neglect, overcrowding, and a loss of dignity for riders.
  </p>

  <p>
    The decline wasn’t limited to the city’s subways. Suburban commuter
    railroads also suffered, especially as Moses’s 1955 Joint Proposal
    prioritized expressways over rail, draining away passengers and leaving the
    railroads financially crippled. While some lines like the New Haven and Penn
    Central started out strong, others, especially the Long Island Rail Road,
    went bankrupt and survived only through state intervention. As private
    companies, the railroads couldn’t compete with the heavily subsidized public
    authorities, leading to mounting losses, fare hikes, and service cuts. This
    created a vicious cycle: each fare increase and service reduction pushed
    more commuters onto highways, further eroding the railroads’ customer base.
    By the 1960s, service had fallen dramatically; the Long Island Rail Road,
    once a robust operation, ran fewer trains despite a booming commuter
    population. The squalid conditions—filthy, broken-down cars, chronic delays,
    and uncomfortable seating—stood in stark contrast to the affluence of its
    suburban riders. Despite their material wealth, commuters endured daily
    indignities and discomfort, all because policy decisions had neglected mass
    transit in favor of highways.
  </p>

  <p>
    The human toll of these policies was severe. Long Island Rail Road commuters
    faced harsh, dehumanizing conditions: trains were freezing in winter and
    sweltering in summer due to outdated, poorly maintained equipment, with
    temperatures dropping to 29 degrees in winter and soaring to 98 in summer.
    Chronic delays, frequent breakdowns, and cancellations—like the infamous
    “Phantom” train—only added to the frustration. These conditions led to
    widespread psychological stress, known as “commuter syndrome,” affecting
    three out of four riders. Over time, commuters became numb to the daily
    discomfort, accepting exhaustion and lost time as a normal part of life. The
    chapter highlights the deep, often invisible human cost of these conditions,
    shaped by Moses’ transportation policies, and how they eroded both
    individual well-being and family life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond the immediate impact on commuters, the chapter explores the broader
    consequences for urban and suburban development. Once models of efficiency,
    suburban railroads like the New Haven fell into neglect and bankruptcy as
    Moses prioritized road construction, fueling massive suburban sprawl and car
    dependency. The development of the Long Island Expressway, without any rapid
    transit integration, encouraged low-density, car-oriented communities,
    eroding the region’s natural beauty and sense of community. The author
    argues that integrating rapid transit could have fostered higher-density,
    walkable neighborhoods, preserved open space, and improved quality of life,
    but Moses’s vision ultimately turned Long Island into a sprawling,
    automobile-dependent suburb.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter makes it clear that building rapid transit along the Long Island
    Expressway was crucial for addressing Long Island’s unique transportation
    challenges. As a dead-end island with all major connections to the west,
    toward New York City, Long Island faced explosive population growth in
    Nassau and Suffolk counties, with most new residents still dependent on jobs
    in Manhattan. The existing roads were already overwhelmed, and forecasts
    predicted massive increases in car commuters, making highway expansion
    impractical—sixty new lanes would have been needed just to keep up. Only
    mass transit, such as trains or dedicated bus lanes, could have handled the
    projected commuter volume efficiently. Despite planners’ pleas, Moses
    refused to include rapid transit or even bus lanes in the expressway’s
    design, missing what the author calls Long Island’s last real chance to
    solve its transportation crisis.
  </p>

  <p>
    In its final pages, the chapter examines the long-term fallout of Moses’s
    decisions. His refusal to set aside space or funding for mass transit
    projects, like a rapid transit line to JFK Airport or modernization of the
    Long Island Rail Road, led to astronomical costs and logistical headaches
    for future improvements. Even massive investments in mass transit would
    barely dent car usage, thanks to low population density and deep-rooted car
    dependency. The core problem is that Long Island’s development was shaped
    around the automobile, resulting in suburbs too spread out for effective
    mass transit. A significant shift won’t happen until much higher densities
    are reached—a solution that remains far off. The chapter argues that Moses’s
    legacy effectively condemned generations of New Yorkers and Long Islanders
    to ongoing transportation struggles, with little hope for real improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, the chapter offers a vivid, detailed account of how Robert
    Moses’s financial and political maneuvering, combined with his unwavering
    commitment to highways over mass transit, reshaped the New York metropolitan
    area. The consequences—neglected transit, sprawling suburbs, and chronic
    congestion—still define the region’s transportation challenges today.
