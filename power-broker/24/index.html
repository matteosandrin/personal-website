  <p>
    This chapter takes a close look at Robert Moses and his sweeping, often
    contentious influence on New York City’s parks and public works during the
    1930s. It paints a vivid portrait of Moses as a driven, politically savvy
    figure whose methods left a lasting mark on the city—sometimes at great cost
    to its most vulnerable residents and to the ideals of urban reformers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ approach was shaped by his acute awareness of the fleeting nature of
    federal funding. He understood that government support could disappear
    without warning, so he moved with urgency, bulldozing through city
    bureaucracy to get projects underway before the money dried up. To make this
    happen, Moses didn’t hesitate to sidestep rules or strong-arm officials. He
    was notorious for using personal attacks and public smear campaigns to
    neutralize anyone who got in his way. One telling example is his treatment
    of Deputy Comptroller Douglas Matthewson. When Matthewson became an
    obstacle, Moses used the press to tarnish his reputation, ensuring that
    resistance was swiftly crushed.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Moses’ tactics went beyond intimidation. He was quick to exploit the
    era’s anti-Communist paranoia, branding his opponents as Communists or
    sympathizers, regardless of the facts. This strategy proved especially
    potent during the “red scare” of the 1930s. The case of Paul J. Kern, a
    trusted aide to Mayor La Guardia, stands out. Kern’s push for civil service
    reforms threatened Moses’ control, so Moses set out to poison Kern’s
    relationship with the mayor through lies and public attacks. Eventually, he
    labeled Kern a Communist, orchestrating a campaign that led to Kern’s
    political ruin. These ruthless maneuvers, which foreshadowed the tactics of
    the McCarthy era, often destroyed the careers and lives of those who dared
    to challenge Moses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses further solidified his power by preying on the anxieties of city
    officials. He manipulated Mayor La Guardia’s fear of being linked to
    Communism to oust reformers like Isaacs and Kern, ensuring his grip on the
    Park Department remained firm. Most commissioners fell in line, bullied into
    submission, though a few, like Windels, managed to resist. Moses also found
    ways around the city’s main funding body, the Board of Estimate, by
    leveraging federal funds and creating a sense of urgency around deadlines.
    He placed loyal aides in key departments and secured funding in stages,
    making it nearly impossible for anyone to halt a project once it had begun.
    These strategies allowed him to push his agenda with little effective
    opposition.
  </p>

  <p>
    When it came to securing money, Moses often downplayed project costs to the
    Board, only to return for more funds once work was underway. His commanding
    presence and deep expertise let him dominate meetings, silencing critics
    with sharp retorts and sheer force of personality. The chapter contrasts the
    relative ease Moses enjoyed building in rural areas, where he could act
    unilaterally, with the far greater challenges of urban projects, which often
    meant displacing people and reshaping neighborhoods—sometimes with
    unpredictable and far-reaching consequences.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter also explores the unique difficulties of planning public works
    in New York City compared to Long Island. In the city, every project had to
    contend with the existing fabric of neighborhoods and the lives of
    residents. Moses’ methods, which worked well on Long Island’s open spaces,
    risked erasing the character and complexity of city neighborhoods if applied
    without care. While his vision was bold, it often failed to account for the
    needs of poorer communities. The author argues that successful urban
    planning depends on engaging with residents and tailoring projects—whether
    parks or highways—to fit local needs. Balancing recreational and
    conservation uses in city parks, especially given limited space and
    competing demands, requires thoughtful, community-driven decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moses’ preference for active recreation over preserving natural spaces is
    illustrated by his work at places like Heckscher State Park, where he valued
    only the developed areas. The chapter discusses the challenges of creating
    small parks in dense neighborhoods, the high costs involved, and the
    importance of community input. As car ownership increased, debates flared
    over whether roads in parks should prioritize beauty or convenience. Moses’
    autocratic style, marked by a refusal to listen to the public, experts, or
    even his own staff, led to a decline in the quality of his team and the
    decisions they made.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Moses took on more responsibilities, his hands-on approach and high
    standards gave way to delegation and standardization, resulting in more
    generic, uninspired designs. Restrictions from agencies like the WPA further
    stifled creativity. Oversights—such as neglecting to accommodate baby
    carriages in city parks—highlighted a growing disconnect from the needs of
    urban park users.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapter is critical of the bleak, utilitarian playgrounds that sprang up
    under Moses’ watch. These spaces were often harsh, unwelcoming, and poorly
    maintained. Attempts to beautify them failed, thanks to vandalism and
    neglect. Moses’ focus on grand projects over small, local parks—especially
    in poorer neighborhoods—meant that efforts like the vest-pocket park
    initiative quickly fizzled out. Reformers, particularly those connected to
    settlement houses, saw the urgent need for parks in slums, arguing that
    green spaces were vital for children’s safety and community health. Yet
    Moses prioritized parks for the middle class, limiting access to large parks
    and neglecting to build small parks where they were needed most.
  </p>

  <p>
    The conflict between Moses and reformers came to a head over the question of
    parks in the 1930s. Moses dismissed calls for small parks in slums as
    impractical, instead pointing to large projects as supposedly accessible
    alternatives. Reformers countered that these were out of reach for many slum
    residents and pushed for local green spaces. They also criticized Moses for
    replacing natural parkland with concrete facilities. Despite some public
    support, reformers struggled to make headway, as Moses remained committed to
    his vision of parks as active, developed spaces rather than natural
    retreats. The chapter closes by reflecting on the enduring impact of Moses’
    philosophy on the city’s green spaces and the communities they were meant to
    serve.
